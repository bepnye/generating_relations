    "text": "Skai TV is a Greek free - to - air television network based in Piraeus . It is part of the Skai Group , one of the largest media groups in the country . It was relaunched in its present form on 1st of April 2006 in the Athens metropolitan area , and gradually spread its coverage nationwide . Besides digital terrestrial transmission , it is available on the subscription - based encrypted services of Nova and Cosmote TV . Skai TV is also a member of Digea , a consortium of private television networks introducing digital terrestrial transmission in Greece . At launch , Skai TV opted for dubbing all foreign language content into Greek , instead of using subtitles . This is very uncommon in Greece for anything except documentaries ( using voiceover dubbing ) and children 's programmes ( using lip - synced dubbing ) , so after intense criticism the station switched to using subtitles for almost all foreign shows .

The second is the social data analytics segment that comprises the analysis of data generated from social networking sites [ such as Twitter or Facebook ] , which can be applied , for example , to financial analysis . The third strategic area is nanotechnology applied to the development of the smarter devices for the intermittent production industry . This technology can be applied to , for example , blood testing or recovering oil from existing fields . And the last one is smarter cities . \" ",

    "text": "Conrad Oberon Johnson ( November 15 , 1915 \u2013 February 3 , 2008 ) was an American music educator , long associated with the city of Houston , who was inducted into the Texas Bandmasters Hall of Fame in 2000 . Born in Victoria , Texas , Conrad Johnson was nine when his family moved to Houston . Following studies at Yates High School , he attended Houston College for Negroes and graduated from Wiley College . He was an active member of Omega Psi Phi Fraternity . He started his career in music education in 1941 and , following a thirty - seven - year career , retired from his position at Kashmere High School in 1978 , but continued to remain active in shaping music in Houston by conducting summer programs and in - home tutoring . Johnson was a proficient musician in his own right and , at one point , played with Count Basie . Erskine Hawkins tried to convince him to join his orchestra , but Johnson declined , citing a love of teaching and obligations to his family . Later , Johnson made his lasting contribution to music by forming the Kashmere Stage Band , a renowned school orchestra that won a number of awards during its decade - long run . The Conrad O. Johnson School of Fine Arts at Kashmere High School is named after him . Conrad O. Johnson died in Houston days after his former students staged a celebration in his honor . The gala Saturday night concert , which was filmed by a documentary crew , was described by the students as \" the greatest 92nd birthday gift that he could have ever requested . \" ",

Born in Los Angeles , California , enlisted in the United States Navy 21 April 1941 . He served on board Lexington ( CV-2 ) and was rated aviation radioman third class before being transferred to Torpedo Squadron 8 on board Hornet ( CV-8 ) . He received the Distinguished Flying Cross for heroism and extraordinary achievement as rear gunner in a torpedo plane during an attack against enemy Japanese forces in the Battle of Midway 4 June 1942 . Flying without fighter support and with insufficient fuel to return to their carrier , Huntington and his fellow crewmember pressed home their attack with utter disregard for their own personal safety , in the face of a tremendous antiaircraft barrage and overwhelming fighter opposition . Huntington was one of 29 from Torpedo Squadron 8 who gave their lives in this attack . ",

Gahn studied in Uppsala 1762 \u2013 1770 and became acquainted with chemists Torbern Bergman and Carl Wilhelm Scheele . 1770 he settled in Falun , where he introduced improvements in copper smelting , and participated in building up several factories , including those for vitriol , sulfur and red paint . He was the chemist for The Swedish Board of Mines Bergskollegium from 1773 \u2013 1817 . Gahn was however very reluctant to publish his scientific findings himself , but freely communicated them to Bergman and Scheele . One of Gahn 's discoveries was that manganese dioxide could be reduced to manganese metal using carbon , becoming the first to isolate this element in its metal form . In 1784 , Gahn was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences . He also made a managerial career in Swedish mining . ",

    "text": "The memogate controversy ( also Mullen memo controversy ) revolves around a memorandum ( addressed to Admiral Mike Mullen ) ostensibly seeking help of the Obama administration in the wake of the Osama bin Laden raid to avert a military takeover of the civilian government in Pakistan , as well as assisting in a civilian takeover of the government and military apparatus . The memo was delivered in May 2011 ; Mansoor Ijaz wrote a Financial Times article in October 2011 bringing initial public attention to the affair . The memo , which at first was questioned to even exist , was published in November , leading to the resignation of Ambassador Haqqani and the continuing Pakistani Supreme Court investigation . Central actors in the plot include Pakistani - American businessman Mansoor Ijaz , who alleged that long - time friend and former Pakistan Ambassador to the United States Husain Haqqani asked him to deliver a confidential memo asking for US assistance . The memo is alleged to have been drafted by Haqqani at the behest of President of Pakistan Asif Ali Zardari . The memo was delivered to Mike Mullen through then National Security Advisor James L. Jones . The Supreme Court of Pakistan has opened a broader inquiry into the origins , credibility and purpose of the memo . On 19 April 2012 a petition was submitted in the Supreme Court to arrest former Pakistan ambassador to US Husain Haqqani through Interpol for his refusal to return to Pakistan . On 12 June the supreme court commission released its findings and found that after testimony by all parties and verifying the forensic results of Ijaz 's BlackBerry conversations with Haqqani it was \" incontrovertibly established \" that Husain Haqqani had written the memo and was being called back to Pakistan to face likely charges of treason .

    "text": "Live in New York was a 2-CD live album released by performance artist Laurie Anderson on Nonesuch Records in 2002 . It was her ninth album of new recordings released since 1982 . The front cover of the CD has the title Live at Town Hall , New York City September 19\u201320 , 2001 , however the official title of the album is just Live in New York . Recorded less than 10 days after the September 11 , 2001 , attacks on New York City , the album was produced during a tour Anderson gave of the United States in which she performed a mixture of older pieces from earlier in her career and newer works , including songs from her then - recent album Life on a String , as well as earlier albums such as United States Live , Big Science , Bright Red , Home of the Brave and Strange Angels . Following so close to the attacks , Anderson makes several statements about them in her recognizable style . The performance is highlighted by a performance of \" O Superman , \" the song that launched Anderson to stardom in 1981 and that contains lyrics that can \u2014 in retrospect \u2014 be seen to relate to the terrorist attacks . One song , \" Progress \" , is a retitled performance of the song \" The Dream Before \" which Anderson debuted in her 1986 short film What You Mean We ? and later featured on Strange Angels . ",

    "text": "Julian Reinard ( born 5 March 1983 ) is a German footballer . He first appeared in the German Bundesliga on 21 March 2004 while SC Freiburg 's first and second keepers had been injured . A year later media and trainer looked upon him as the future number one of Freiburg , but his disastrous effort during a 0\u20137 defeat against Bayern Munich and the following massive public criticism terminated these ambitions . While plying his trade at Hakoah Amidar / Ramat Gan on 23 October 2006 he became the first German footballer ever to play a professional match in Israel . Due to problems with his groin he quit Ramat Gan and , after a brief spell at FC Wil , is currently without a team . ",

He also wrote under the pseudonyms Kaspar Hauser ( after the historical figure ) , Peter Panter , Theobald Tiger and Ignaz Wrobel . Born in Berlin - Moabit , he moved to Paris in 1924 and then to Sweden in 1929 . Tucholsky was one of the most important journalists of the Weimar Republic . As a politically engaged journalist and temporary co - editor of the weekly magazine Die Weltb\u00fchne he proved himself to be a social critic in the tradition of Heinrich Heine . He was simultaneously a satirist , an author of satirical political revues , a songwriter and a poet . He saw himself as a left - wing democrat and pacifist and warned against anti - democratic tendencies \u2013 above all in politics , the military and justice \u2013 and the threat of National Socialism . His fears were confirmed when the Nazis came to power in January 1933 . In May of that year he was among the authors whose works were banned as \" un - German \" , and burned ; he was also among the first authors and intellectuals whose German citizenship was revoked .

    "text": "The Old Loggers Path ( OLP ) is a loop hiking trail in Lycoming County in north - central Pennsylvania in the United States . Marked with international orange blazes , the Old Loggers Path is located entirely within the Loyalsock State Forest . Most hikers take two and a half to three days and two nights to complete the Old Loggers Path , making it popular for weekend hikes . Highlights of the trail include waterfalls , several scenic streams and creeks ( most of which do not have bridges ) , and panoramic vistas . The land the Old Loggers Path is on was initially owned and clear - cut by the Union Tanning Company , followed by the Central Pennsylvania Lumber Company . The trail chiefly follows the grades of abandoned logging roads and railroads , and its trailhead is the lumber ghost town of Masten . Parts of the trail were made by the Civilian Conservation Corps , which operated a camp in the area from 1933 to 1941 . ",

    "text": "Paul Charles Morphy ( June 22 , 1837 \u00a0 \u2013 July 10 , 1884 ) was an American chess player . He is considered to have been the greatest chess master of his era and an unofficial World Chess Champion . A chess prodigy , he was called \" The Pride and Sorrow of Chess \" because he had a brilliant chess career but retired from the game while still young . Bobby Fischer ranked him among the ten greatest players of all time , and described him as \" perhaps the most accurate player who ever lived \" . Morphy was born in New Orleans to a wealthy and distinguished family . He learned to play chess by simply watching games between his father and uncle . His family soon recognized the boy 's talent and encouraged him to play at family gatherings , and by the age of nine he was considered to be one of the best players in the city . At just twelve years of age , Morphy defeated visiting Hungarian master Johann L\u00f6wenthal in a match of three games . After receiving his degree in 1857 , Morphy was not yet of legal age to practice law and found himself with free time . At his uncle 's urging , he accepted an invitation to play at the First American Chess Congress in New York City . After winning the tournament , which included strong players such as Alexander Meek and Louis Paulsen , Morphy was hailed as the chess champion of the United States and stayed in New York playing chess through 1857 , winning the vast majority of his games . In 1858 , Morphy traveled to Europe to play European Champion Howard Staunton . Morphy played almost every strong player in Europe , usually winning easily . The match with Staunton never materialized , but Morphy was acclaimed by most in Europe as the world 's best player . Returning to the United States in triumph , Morphy toured the major cities playing chess on his way back to New Orleans . By 1859 , on returning to New Orleans , Morphy declared he was retiring from chess to begin his law career . However , Morphy was never able to establish a successful law practice and ultimately lived a life of idleness , living off his family 's fortune . Despite appeals from his chess admirers , Morphy never returned to the game , and died in 1884 from a stroke at the age of 47 . ",

    "text": "America 's Sweetheart is the debut studio album by American alternative rock musician Courtney Love , released worldwide on February 10 , 2004 by Virgin Records . Her first official release after her former band Hole 's break - up , the album 's sound diverged significantly in musical and lyrical content to Hole 's three previous studio albums : Pretty on the Inside ( 1991 ) , Live Through This ( 1994 ) and Celebrity Skin ( 1998 ) . The recording process of the album began in summer 2001 in Los Angeles , California , however , was affected drastically by a number of personal and legal issues by Love ; including her drug problems , the disbandment of Hole , the controversy surrounding Nirvana 's upcoming box set , and legal problems with various record labels . In spring 2003 , Love traveled to southern France to re - record the album , however , according to Love , she \" just wanted to be in a ch\u00e2teau for six months and do drugs . \" The album had three main producers , one of whom , James Barber , was Love 's partner at the time . Following recording , America 's Sweetheart was further delayed due to Virgin 's excessive input on the album 's mastering , art work and design , and track listing . Upon its release , it received little promotion , with the main source of media exposure being a music video for the album 's first single , \" Mono , \" and Love 's highly publicised drug issues . America 's Sweetheart received mixed reviews and was a commercial failure , selling little over 200,000 copies in the United States , and with Love further citing the album as \" a mistake . \" In more recent years , both Love and producer Linda Perry have referred to the album as \" le disaster \" and \" ruined because [ Love ] was coked out , \" respectively . The album featured drumming from former Hole drummer Patty Schemel , as well as guest instrumentation and vocals from Emilie Autumn . ",

    "text": "Brooks Pharmacy was a chain of more than 330 pharmacies located throughout New England and New York and has been a well - recognized name in the New England pharmacy industry for several decades . The corporate headquarters were located in Warwick , Rhode Island . During its heyday in the late 1990s and early 2000s , Brooks was one of the premier regional drug chains in the United States , and was the second largest drug chain in New England , maintaining an especially strong presence in the states of Vermont , New Hampshire , and Rhode Island . In 2002 , Brooks was recipient of the 2002 Rex Awards Regional Chain of the Year . However , Brooks faced many difficulties between 2004 and 2006 , as its parent company struggled unsuccessfully to integrate 1,500 Eckerd stores acquired from J.C. Penney with the existing Brooks network , resulting in a steady loss of market share and lagging same - store sales as CVS and Walgreens continued to expand and solidify their store base in the New England region . In 2007 , Brooks Pharmacy officially announced the sale of the pharmacy to Rite - Aid Pharmacy . The Brooks trade name , long associated with New England drug retailing , was retired . ",

    "text": "Bicycles & Tricycles is the sixth studio album from the Orb . It brought together The Orb 's style of the early 1990s with current electronic music to mixed reactions . The Daily Telegraph praised Bicycles & Tricycles as being \" inclusive , exploratory , and an enjoyable journey \" ; however , many other publications dismissed it as \" stoner dub \" and largely irrelevant to current electronic music culture . In addition to Paterson , Roome , Phillips , and Fehlmann , The Corporal contributed with vocoder affected singing and MC Soom - T provided lyrics and rapped . Orb co - founder Jimmy Cauty , too , made a guest appearance as co - writer on Bicycles & Tricycles ' \" From a Distance \" . After departing from Island Records , The Orb released Bicycles & Tricycles in 2004 on Cooking Vinyl in the United Kingdom and Sanctuary Records in the United States . To promote the album , The Orb began a UK tour with dub reggae artist Mad Professor , who had remixed The Orb in the past . Though The Orb still pulled in large crowds , The Guardian described one London performance as \" joyless \" and stated that \" few of the new tracks ... really go anywhere \" . They also noted that Paterson seemed to be far more comfortable and happier to play material from Bicycles & Tricycles rather than older tracks . Paterson 's biggest influences for the album were drum and bass and trip hop music . ",

    "text": "Chachalacas are galliform birds from the genus Ortalis . These birds are found in wooded habitats in far southern United States ( Texas ) , Mexico , and Central and South America . They are social , can be very noisy and often remain fairly common even near humans , as their relatively small size makes them less desirable to hunters than their larger relatives . As invasive pests , they have a ravenous appetite for tomatoes , melons , beans , and radishes and can ravage a small garden in short order . They travel in packs of six to twelve . They somewhat resemble the guans , and the two have commonly been placed in a subfamily together , though the chachalacas are probably closer to the curassows . The generic name is derived from the Greek word \u03cc\u03c1\u03c4\u03b1\u03bb\u03b9\u03c2 , meaning \" pullet \" or \" domestic hen . \" The common name is an onomatopoeia for the four - noted cackle of the plain chachalaca ( O. vetula ) . Mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequence data tentatively suggest that the chachalacas emerged as a distinct lineage during the Oligocene , somewhere around 40\u201320 mya , possibly being the first lineage of modern cracids to evolve ; this does agree with the known fossil record \u2013 including indeterminate , cracid - like birds \u2013 which very cautiously favors a north - to - south expansion of the family .

    "text": "The Gershonites were one of the four main divisions among the Levites in Biblical times . The Bible claims that the Gershonites were all descended from the eponymous Gershon , a son of Levi , although some biblical scholars regard this as a postdictional metaphor providing an aetiology of the connectedness of the clan to others in the Israelite confederation . The Bible ascribes a specific religious function to the Gershonites , namely care of the curtains , hangings , and ropes of the sanctuary . This differentiation of religious activity between the Gershonites and other Levites , in particular the Aaronids , is found only in the Priestly Code , and not in passages that textual scholars attribute to other authors . According to the Book of Joshua , rather than possessing a continuous territory , the Gershonites possessed several cities scattered throughout the geographic regions of Galilee and Bashan : in the territory of Manasseh : Golan , and Beeshterah in the territory of Issachar : Kishon , Dabareh , Jarmuth , and En - gannim in the territory of Asher : Mishal , Abdon , Helkath , and Rehob in the territory of Naphtali : Kedesh , Hammoth - dor , and Kartan ",

    "text": "The Think Bike Campaign was started by biking enthusiasts in South Africa , and is run by bikers , in the interests of road safety and public awareness . Many motorcycle accidents happen because of a lack of awareness of the issues among the general motoring public . The aim of the campaign is to correct that through the use of stickers , leaflets , and information distributed in other ways . During 2005 , a number of bikers were using an online forum to discuss the alarming number of unnecessary motorcycle accidents ; avoidable accidents caused by inattentiveness , ignorance , incompetence and failure to exercise due care . The Think Bike sticker campaign started by Tony Day of Cape Town in the 1980s , and its short life were discussed , and it was decided then and there to revive the campaign and expand on its goals and methods . The campaign , while strongest in the Gauteng province , has representation in Western Cape , KwaZulu Natal and the Free State . It has dozens of trained marshals available for various events such as cycle races and is deeply involved in numerous other projects , such as the annual Toy Run . A number of studies have been done in the past , most notably in the United States and United Kingdom , that show that an alarming number of motorcycle accidents are directly caused by other vehicles . Being as vulnerable as they are , bikers very often emerge from these avoidable accidents seriously injured , maimed or dead . The campaign is also aimed at the biking community , to educate about safety issues and encourage the use of protective clothing . The Hurt Report , published in the United States in 1981 , showed some alarming trends . More than 900 motorcycle accidents were investigated in the Los Angeles area , and the results showed that : Approximately three fourths of motorcycle accidents involve collision with another vehicle , usually a passenger automobile . In these accidents , the driver of the other vehicle violated the motorcycle right of way and caused the accident in two thirds of cases . The failure of motorists to detect and recognise motorcycles in traffic is the predominating cause of motorcycle accidents . The driver of the other vehicle involved in collision with the motorcycle did not see the motorcycle before the collision or did not see the motorcycle until too late to avoid the collision . ",

The ports of Port Lavaca and Point Comfort have been established on the bay , and are the main areas of human habitation . Linnville was located on the bay until its abandonment after the Great Raid of 1840 , and the major port of Indianola was found near the confluence with the main Matagorda Bay , until the town 's final destruction following the massive hurricane of 1886 . Smaller communities include Olivia , Alamo Beach and Magnolia Beach . Lavaca Bay is approximately northeast of Corpus Christi , about southwest of Houston , and southeast of San Antonio . The bay is noted for its superfund site , caused by mercury pollution from the heavy industry in Point Comfort ( specifically Alcoa ) , across the bay from the largest settlement of Port Lavaca . Although fishing has declined in recent years due to fears of contamination , the bay supports a large finfish population , and the efforts of environmental organizations and the federal government have pressured Alcoa to reduce the polluted areas .

The name \u2014 a conflation of Wellington and Hollywood \u2014 is a reference to the film production business established in the city by The Lord of the Rings film director Sir Peter Jackson , and Wellington - based special effects companies Weta Workshop and Weta Digital . The businesses operate a number of film - related facilities in the Wellington suburb of Miramar . In March 2010 , the Wellington Airport company announced plans to erect a Hollywood - style sign Wellywood on a hillside next to the Miramar cutting . After the airport considered a range of alternatives , it was announced in May 2011 that the Wellywood sign would be going ahead . However this was met with enormous criticism , and on 1 June 2011 it was announced that a panel would be convened to consider alternative sign options . The panel ran a binding public poll on The Dominion Post website with the ' Wellington Blown Away ' design being chosen . The sign was erected 27 July 2012 . ",

It consists entirely of songs performed from the band 's 1989 record Disintegration ; while they were on their international Prayer tour . Entreat was distributed exclusively in France as a promotional tool . When bootlegs began to surface , however , the album was given a limited European release . Entreat was also given away free by HMV stores in the UK and Ireland to customers who purchased two CDs from the band 's back catalogue . The last two tracks were released in 1989 as B - sides to the US version of \" Lullaby \" . \" Fascination Street \" , \" Last Dance \" , \" Prayers For Rain \" , and \" Disintegration \" were also included as B - sides on the \" Pictures of You \" CD single . The re - release of Disintegration in 2010 featured a remastered and remixed version of Entreat , entitled Entreat Plus because it featured all twelve songs from the album , including the four excluded from the original . It was the first time the album was released worldwide , though it had already been released on CD before . ",

Born in Scugog Island , Ontario , Frise moved to Toronto at 19 and found illustration work on the Toronto Stars Star Weekly supplement . His left hand was severely injured at the Battle of Vimy Ridge in 1917 during World War \u00a0 I , but his drawing hand was unhurt , and he continued cartooning at the Star upon his return . In 1919 he began his first weekly comic strip , Life 's Little Comedies , which evolved into the rural - centred humorous Birdseye in 1923 . He moved to the Montreal Standard in 1947 , but as the Star kept publication rights to Birdseye Center , Frise continued it as Juniper Junction with strongly similar characters and situations . Doug Wright took over the strip after Frise 's sudden death from a heart attack in 1948 , and it went on to become the longest - running strip in English - Canadian comics history . ",

A typical metropolitan area is centered on a single large city that wields substantial influence over the region ( e.g. , \u00a0 New York City or Philadelphia ) .

    "text": "The Loopline Bridge ( or the Liffey Viaduct ) is a railway bridge spanning the River Liffey and several streets in Dublin , Ireland . It joins rail services from south of Dublin to Connolly Station and lines north . Designed by John Chaloner Smith ( engineer to the Dublin , Wicklow and Wexford Railway ) , the bridge was built between 1889 and 1891 . It consists of wrought iron lattice girders on a double row of piers with five spans . The viaduct is approximately six metres above street level and supports two railway tracks . During original planning and construction ( in the late 19th century ) the project was subject to much opposition and controversy , because the structure blocks the view down river to The Custom House . However , the bridge was deemed necessary as a rail link between north and south Dublin , and to facilitate the movement of transatlantic mail coming from Kingstown ( D\u00fan Laoghaire ) and Queenstown ( Cobh ) . 100 years later , the visage of the bridge remains the subject of some debate . Already arguably less attractive than some of Dublin 's other bridges , the fa\u00e7ades of the Loopline have been used by Iarnr\u00f3d \u00c9ireann for billboard advertising . , the company has scaled back the bridge 's use for this purpose to reduce impact on the city skyline , following input from An Bord Plean\u00e1la and Dublin City Council . A prominent feature in the city landscape since 1891 , the Loopline Bridge appears in one of the most famous literary works associated with Dublin : ",

    "text": "The Swingles are a vocal group formed in 1962 in Paris , France by Ward Swingle with Anne Germain , Claude Germain , Jeanette Baucomont , Christiane Legrand , Claudine Meunier , Jean - Claude Briodin , and Jean Cussac . Until 2011 , the group consisted of eight voices : two sopranos , two altos , two tenors and two basses . The French group performed and recorded typically with only a double bass and drums as accompaniment . In 1973 , the original French group disbanded and Ward Swingle moved to London and hired members who debuted as Swingle II . The current group performs primarily a cappella . The group later performed and recorded under the name The Swingles , then The New Swingle Singers and The Swingle Singers before settling on The Swingles . The group has never disbanded . As individual members have left the group , remaining members have held auditions for replacements . ",

    "text": "Manon Balletti ( 1740 \u2013 1776 ) was the daughter of Italian actors performing in France and lover of the famous womanizer Giacomo Casanova . She was ten years old when she first met him ; she happened to be the daughter of Silvia Balletti , an actress of the Com\u00e9die Italienne company and younger sister of Casanova 's closest friend . The lovers started their relationship when Casanova was thirty - two years old and Manon was seventeen . ( Although Manon 's mother was associated with acting , considered disreputable at the time , mother and daughter were observed by Casanova to be of a \" pure nature \" . ) She wrote forty - two letters full of love and deep feelings for him ; a well - known quote from these letters describes Casanova as : \" My lover , my husband , my friend \" . Casanova 's sexual passions caused him to be unfaithful , causing their three - year relationship to have numerous ups and downs . Yet she continued to share his home , found in Rue du Petit - Lion - St . Sauveur . Manon was at the time engaged to her clavichord teacher , but broke it off at Casanova 's request , thus starting a new engagement with him . This did not keep him from having various sexual relations with other women , yet Manon remained faithful to him . His memoirs record his regret for being unkind to her when having these affairs . Once Casanova was imprisoned after he was sued by creditors in Paris . Manon sent a pair of diamond earrings with which she bought him out . Subsequently she ended the engagement and returned his portrait and letters . Manon married the architect Jacques - Fran\u00e7ois Blondel a short while after , disappointing Casanova , who believed that he would one day be able to settle down with her . Manon died at the age of 36 , questionably from pulmonary hypertension . Casanova wrote in his memoirs that he believed his behavior shortened her life . ",

Guitarist Jimmy Page and singer Robert Plant began writing it in the summer of 1975 and were influenced by Eastern music , mythology , and travels . At ten and a half minutes , it is one of the group 's longest studio recordings and one of their most complex , with different interwoven sections and multiple overdubbed guitar parts . It was released in March 1976 as the opening track for their seventh studio album , Presence . The song received positive reviews , with comparisons to other epic - style Led Zeppelin songs , such as \" Kashmir \" . Between 1977 and 1980 , it was a feature of the group 's concerts and a live performance from 1979 is included on the Led Zeppelin DVD ( 2003 ) . In several interviews , Page named it as his favourite Led Zeppelin piece and places his guitar solo on a par with \" Stairway to Heaven \" . ",

    "text": "The was a 1905 discussion ( not an agreement ) between senior leaders of Japan and the United States regarding the positions of the two nations in greater East Asian affairs , especially regarding the status of Korea and Philippines in the aftermath of Japan 's victory in the Russo - Japanese War . It was not an \" agreement \" and did not set out any new policies , but a memorandum . The memorandum was not classified as a secret but no scholar noticed it in the archives until 1924 . The discussions were between United States Secretary of War William Howard Taft and Prime Minister of Japan ( Count ) Katsura Tar\u014d on 27 July 1905 . The Japanese leader stated Japan 's reasons for its making a protectorate of Korea . He repeated that Japan had no interest in the Philippines . The US had acquired the Philippines following its victory over Spain in the Spanish \u2013 American War of 1898 . In 1924 , Tyler Dennett was the first scholar to see the document ; he described it as containing \" the text of perhaps the most remarkable ' executive agreement ' in the history of the foreign relations of the United States \" . The consensus of historians is that Dennett greatly exaggerated the importance of a routine discussion that changed nothing and set no new policies . Historians pointed out there was no formal agreement on anything new . The word \" agreement \" in the documents merely means the two sides agreed that the English and Japanese versions of the meeting notes both accurately covered the substance of the conversations . President Theodore Roosevelt later agreed that War Secretary Taft had correctly stated the American position . When Dennett first discovered the notes he assumed they indicated a highly significant \" secret pact \" between the US and Japan in creating a basis agreement whereby the two formerly isolationist nations became world powers . The conversations regarded the extent of the spheres of influence of Japan and the United States , and maintaining peace between them , in the event of victory of Japan over Russia in the Russo - Japanese War . Some Korean historians have assumed that , in the discussions , the United States recognized Japan 's sphere of influence in Korea ; in exchange , Japan recognized the United States ' sphere of influence in the Philippines . However , American historians examining official records report no agreement was ever made \u2014 the two men discussed current events but came to no new policy or agreement . They both restated the well - known official policies of their own governments . Indeed , Taft was very careful to indicate these were his private opinions , and he was not an official representative of the U.S. government ( Taft was Secretary of War , not Secretary of State ) .

    "text": "Washington v. Texas , 388 U.S. 14 ( 1967 ) , is a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court decided that the Compulsory Process Clause of the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution ( guaranteeing the right of a criminal defendant to force the attendance of witnesses for their side ) is applicable in state courts as well as federal courts . Jackie Washington had attempted to call his co - defendant as a witness , but was blocked by Texas courts because state law prevented co - defendants from testifying for each other , under the theory that they would be likely to lie for each other on the stand . The Supreme Court reasoned that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment made the right to be able to compel defense witnesses to testify necessary for a defendant 's \" due process \" rights to fair proceedings , which applies to the states . Only Justice John Marshall Harlan II parted from the Court 's \" due process \" focus , though he agreed with the outcome , as he regularly did in cases involving whether to apply federal rights to state courts . The impact of Washington was narrowed by a later case , Taylor v. Illinois ( 1988 ) , in which the Court said that \" countervailing public interests \" , like the need to move through cases quickly , could be balanced against a defendant 's right to present witnesses . In Taylor , the Supreme Court upheld a judge 's order blocking defense witnesses from testifying due to the defense attorney 's deliberate failure to disclose evidence to prosecutors earlier in the trial . The defense attorney 's actions resulted in a lengthy delay in the proceedings which the trial judge felt was unjustified . Legal scholars have seen this new grant of discretion to trial judges as a change to relying on \" efficient justice \" , a more limited vision of trial rights than the \" right to present a defense \" created in Washington .

It was commissioned by Macarius , Metropolitan of Moscow from Ivan the Terrible 's personal confessor , Andrew , in 1560 . This vast work of codification recast historical data compiled from medieval Russian chronicles so as to suit Ivan 's tastes and ambitions in the wake of his coronation as the first Russian Czar . The book gave shape to the idea of Moscow being the \" Third Rome \" by tracing Ivan 's patrilineal descent not only from Rurik but from the first Roman emperor , Augustus . This fantasy genealogy was borrowed from the earlier Tale of the Princes of Vladimir . The compilation is subdivided into 17 parts , or degrees ( hence the title ) . Each degree corresponds to a generation of Ivan 's royal ancestors . According to Arthur Voice , the book \" glorifies to the utmost the historic past and the present of Muscovite Rus ' , primarily by extolling the rulers as having acted in full accord with the church \" . The biographies of Kievan , Vladimir - Suzdal and Muscovite rulers tend to pass over into hagiography . Each monarch is presented as a saint , and his actions are cast as \" holy deeds \" . The political philosophy of the time tends to be obscured by thick layers of bombast and rhetoric . ",

    "text": "The Riksakten was the 1815 Act of Union that regulated the terms of the constitutional personal union between Sweden and Norway established in 1814 . The fundamental documents of the union were only the Convention of Moss and the revised Norwegian constitution of 4 November 1814 . The Norwegian constitution had been adapted to the union before it was entered into , but the Swedish one was never adjusted correspondingly . The conservative Swedish Riksdag had not allowed the Swedish constitution of 1809 to be revised . Therefore , a bilateral treaty had to be negotiated in order to clarify procedures for treating constitutional questions that had to be decided jointly by both governments . The Act of Union ( Riksakten ) was negotiated during the spring of 1815 , with prime minister Peder Anker leading the Norwegian delegation . The treaty contained twelve articles dealing with the king 's authority , the relationship between the two legislatures , how the executive power was to be exercised if the king should die before the crown prince had attained majority , and the relationship between the cabinets . It also confirmed the practice of treating questions of foreign policy in the Swedish cabinet , with the Norwegian prime minister present . Vital questions pertaining to the Union were to be treated in a joint cabinet meeting , where all the Norwegian ministers in Stockholm would be present . The Act was passed by the Storting 31 July 1815 and by the Riksdag 6 August , and sanctioned by the king on 15 August . In Sweden the Act of Union was a set of provisions under regular law , but the Norwegian Storting gave it constitutional status , so that its provisions could only be revised according to the procedures laid down in the constitution . The Riksakten contained 12 paragraphs : ",

    "text": "Guillermo David Endara Galimany ( May 12 , 1936 \u2013 September 28 , 2009 ) was President of Panama from 1989 to 1994 . Raised in a family allied to Paname\u00f1ista Party founder Arnulfo Arias , Endara attended school in exile in the United States and Argentina following Arias 's removal from power . Endara later received a law degree in Panama . He subsequently served as a member of Panama 's National Assembly , and briefly as a government minister before heading into exile again following Arias ' third overthrow . After Arias ' death in 1988 , Endara became a leading opponent of the Manuel Noriega military dictatorship , heading the opposition coalition in the 1989 presidential election . Though his coalition was judged by international observers as having defeated pro - Noriega candidate Carlos Duque , the results were annulled by the government , and Endara and his running mates were attacked in the streets by the paramilitary Dignity Battalions . The assaults received widespread coverage in international media , helping to build support within the U.S. for military action against Noriega . Seven months later , the United States invaded Panama . Endara was sworn in as the new president on the first night of the invasion on a U.S. military base . During his presidency , Endara abolished the Panamanian military and replaced it with a national police force . Endara 's term saw steady economic growth and a return of democratic institutions , but also high unemployment rates . His administration was marked by internal fighting , and his popularity plummeted . He was succeeded by opposition candidate Ernesto P\u00e9rez Balladares on September 1 , 1994 . Endara ran for office again in 2004 and 2009 , but lost to Democratic Revolutionary Party candidate Mart\u00edn Torrijos and to independent candidate Ricardo Martinelli . He died of a heart attack on September 28 , 2009 , several months after his last campaign . ",

    "text": "A Bantustan ( also known as Bantu homeland , black homeland , black state or simply homeland ; ) was a territory set aside for black inhabitants of South Africa and South West Africa ( now Namibia ) , as part of the policy of apartheid . Ten Bantustans were established in South Africa , and then in neighbouring South West Africa ( then under South African administration ) , for the purpose of concentrating the members of designated ethnic groups , thus making each of those territories ethnically homogeneous as the basis for creating \" autonomous \" nation states for South Africa 's different black ethnic groups . The term was first used in the late 1940s and was coined from Bantu ( meaning \" people \" in some of the Bantu languages ) and -stan ( a suffix meaning \" land \" in the Persian language and some Persian - influenced languages of western , central , and southern Asia ) . It was regarded as a disparaging term by some critics of the apartheid - era government 's \" homelands \" ( from Afrikaans tuisland ) . The word \" bantustan \" , today , is often used in a pejorative sense when describing a region that lacks any real legitimacy , consists of several unconnected enclaves , or emerges from national or international gerrymandering . Four of the South African Bantustans \u2014 Transkei , Bophuthatswana , Venda , and Ciskei ( the so - called \" TBVC States\")\u2014were declared independent , but this was not recognised outside South Africa . Other South African Bantustans ( like KwaZulu , Lebowa , and QwaQwa ) received partial autonomy but were never granted independence . In South West Africa , Ovamboland , Kavangoland , and East Caprivi were granted self - determination . The Bantustans were abolished with the end of apartheid and re - joined South Africa proper in 1994 . ",

    "text": "Kerstin Thorborg ( May 19 , 1896 - April 12 , 1970 ) Born in Venjan , Sweden , the contralto Kerstin Thorborg was one of the best dramatic Wagnerian singers in the two decades between 1930 and 1950 . She made her debut in 1924 singing the difficult role of Ortrud in Lohengrin . Eight years later , the famed conductor Bruno Walter engaged her for the St\u00e4dtische Oper in Berlin and became her mentor . Although a contralto , Thorborg 's upper register was so secure that she sang numerous mezzo - soprano roles , including Venus , Kundry , Fricka , Waltraute , and Magdalena . She was especially known for her searingly beautiful Brang\u00e4ne , which was preserved on record . She also appears to wonderful advantage in the live recording of Mahler 's Das Lied von der Erde , with Charles Kullmann , under Bruno Walter , at the Vienna Musikverein in 1936 . In 1938 , to escape the Nazis , she made her home in the United States , singing various roles at the Met . She returned to her native Sweden in 1950 , after her retirement . By all accounts , Thorborg was a magnificent actor with great stage presence . In addition , she was endowed with a beautifully steady and intense tone . ",

    "text": "\" Surreal \" ( stylized as \" SURREAL \" ) is a song by Japanese recording artist Ayumi Hamasaki , taken from her third studio album Duty ( 2000 ) . It was written by Hamasaki and produced by Max Matsuura . The song is a rock with elements of alternative rock . \" Surreal \" describes Hamasaki 's madness and sense of confusion , while the themes of \" Surreal \" are based on Hamasaki 's concept of loneliness , chaos , confusion , and the burden of her responsibilities , aimed mostly toward her public image as a recording artist . It was released as the fourth single from the album on 27 September 2000 by Avex Trax and Avex Taiwan . Critical reception towards \" Surreal \" has been positive ; the majority of critics commended the songwriting and musical delivery , and highlighted it as an album and career standout . In Japan , \" Surreal \" became her sixth number one on the Oricon Singles Chart , and also reached the top spot on the Japanese Count Down TV chart . \" Surreal \" was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of Japan ( RIAJ ) for shipments of 250,000 units . Released as a DVD Single in December 2000 , it reached number three on the Oricon DVD Chart . The accompanying music video was directed by Wataru Takeishi , featuring Hamasaki walking along a beach front . With mysterious lighting hovering over several objects , she enters a jungle - like room to find a clone of herself ; the clone wears the same outfit for the Duty and \" Surreal \" photo shoot . \" Surreal \" has been included on several concert tours and New Year Countdown shows held and hosted by Hamasaki , and has featured on majority of her greatest hits compilations .

    "text": "Oecophora bractella is a species of gelechioid moth . It belongs to the subfamily Oecophorinae of the concealer moth family ( Oecophoridae ) . As the type species of its genus Oecophora , its affiliations and phylogeny ( which are not completely known however ) determine the delimitation of that family and subfamily . It is native to Europe , where it inhabits woodland . The species is not often found in the outlying regions ; in the UK for example it has only been recorded from a few patches of old - growth forest in the English Midlands ( e.g. Wyre Forest ) , southern England , and southern Wales ( e.g. in the Wye valley ) . The adults ' wingspan is 12\u201316 \u00a0 mm . Conspicuously bicolored black and yellow , they also have some iridescent blue markings on the forewings . The adult moths fly from May to July depending on the location ; they are semi - diurnal and can be encountered during the day , but usually are active at dawn . The caterpillars feed on dead and decaying wood , and possibly also on fungi . ",

    "text": "Cassels Lake ( originally known as White Bear Lake ) is a lake located within the Municipality of Temagami , in the Nipissing District , Ontario , Canada . It contains numerous portages , campsites and is one of three lakes on the eastern edge of the White Bear Forest . In the 1920s a log dam was constructed at the narrows connecting Cassels Lake and Rabbit Lake to float logs from the surrounding area out to the Ottawa River . The water level in numerous lakes close to Temagami was increased numerous feet . The Gillies ' Bros. logging company then cut the trees from the land and the flooded forest area leaving behind the snags and stumps seen in the water . The old growth white pine and red pine immediately south of the mill was never cut and remains today as the 400-year - old White Bear Forest . According to local folklore , this stand was n't cut because the wife of the mill manager wanted to look out of her home on the majestic pine forest , and so forbid him from cutting there . The White Bear Forest on the south side of the lake , opposite the former mill , is now a conservation reserve . The reserve has a system of hiking trails , which provide visitors with a great opportunity to experience the old growth pine forest . ",

    "text": "The East Asia Economic Caucus ( EAEC ) or East Asia Economic Group ( EAEG ) was a regional free trade zone ( FTA ) proposed in 1997 by Malaysian Prime Minister Dr. Mahathir bin Mohamad and encompasses the Association of Southeast Asian Nations ( ASEAN ) member states , China , Japan , and the Republic of Korea . Japan though refused participation due to the exclusion of the Western nations , which were already members of APEC and many other notable regional organizations in East Asia . The EAEC was a reaction to ASEAN 's integration into the Asia - Pacific Economic Cooperation ( APEC ) by Dr. Mahathir , who is known for his strong Asian standpoint . His suggestion apparently articulated his dissatisfaction with ASEAN joining APEC , which includes Western nations , an idea he was strongly opposed to . Therefore , EAEC was basically an APEC without North America and Australia . Nevertheless , it was never put into action officially . Recently the ASEAN+3 rounds might be called the successor of EAEC , which prompted Malaysia to state that EAEC was a reality . In 2005 , due to Japan 's support of the agreement , ASEAN Plus Three(ASEAN+3 or APT)agreed to include Australia , New Zealand , and India during the East Asia Summit . ",

    "text": "The Australia \u2013 Chile Free Trade Agreement is a trade agreement between the countries of Chile and Australia . It was signed on July 30 , 2008 and went into effect in the 1st quarter of 2009 . The agreement was intended to go into effect on January 1 , 2009 , but was delayed due to Chile not being able to finish its ratification in time . Trade between Chile and Australia is modest , involving $ 856 m in 2007 . Australia is the fourth largest provider of foreign direct investment in Chile with over $ 3 billion in 2007 . Chile ranks as Australia 's 41st trading partner . Australia 's main exports to Chile were coal ( $ 94 million ) and civil engineering equipment ( $ 21 million ) . Trade from Chile is copper ( $ 96 million ) , and pulp and waste paper ( $ 57 million ) . When enacted , the Agreement calls for Chile to eliminate tariffs on 91.9 % of tariffs which cover 96.9 % of trade from Australia . Australia will cut 90.8 % of tariffs which cover 97.1 % of trade from Chile . By year six of the Agreement ( 2015 ) , all tariffs will be discarded except for Chile 's sugar tariff which will remain subject to its current \u2018 price band\u2019 system . The tariffs in Australia , that will stay in place until 2015 , will be relating to textile and the clothing industry along with table grapes . In Chile , the agreement will protect the textile and clothing industry and some other manufactured products . According to the Australian Government , the government hopes to use the Agreement as a model for other free trade agreements with other countries . Before passage of the Agreement farmers and horticulturists protested the Agreement in front of the Australian Parliament . The protesters claim that this agreement would undercut Australian food producers by allowing in cheap food goods from Chile . Simon Crean , Australia 's Minister for Trade , responded to the farmers concerns by stating that tariffs are quite low or in some cases nonexistent due to previous international trade agreements . Chile and Australia agreed in principle to start negotiations on December 8 , 2006 . Negotiations started on July 18 , 2007 and after four rounds of talks , concluded on May 27 , 2008 . ",

    "text": "Zabiele ( ) is a village in the administrative district of Gmina Wielbark , within Szczytno County , Warmian - Masurian Voivodeship , in northern Poland . It lies approximately north - east of Wielbark , south of Szczytno , and south - east of the regional capital Olsztyn . Before 1945 the area was part of Germany ( East Prussia ) . In the East Prussian plebiscite of 1920 , which was largely boycotted by ethnic Poles , the inhabitants voted to remain in Germany . After World War II the region was placed under Polish administration by the Potsdam Agreement under territorial changes demanded by the Soviet Union . Most Germans fled or were expelled and replaced with Poles expelled from the Polish areas annexed by the Soviet Union or Ukrainians forced to settle in the area through Operation Vistula in 1947 . ",

    "text": "On June 19 , 2007 , the Vatican , under the direction of Pope Benedict XVI and Cardinal Renato Martino , issued a 36-page document entitled Guidelines for the Pastoral Care of the Road , created by the curial Pontifical Council for Migrants and Itinerant People , under the leadership of Renato Raffaele Cardinal Martino , and intended for bishop conferences around the world . The document specifically states that it is aimed at bishops , priests , religious and other pastoral workers in hopes of pastoral caregivers paying greater attention to expressions of human mobility . The document derived some of its material from the Old Testament , the New Testament , the American Automobile Association , and statements by Popes Pius XII , John XXIII , Paul VI and John Paul II . On its issue this document received a lot of media attention due to its listing of Ten Commandments for Drivers . In essence , the Vatican is pointing out that the act of driving has a moral and ethical component . The Guidelines make note of both the benefits of the use of automobiles as well as its dangerous and negative consequences . The problem is not as pervasive in the Vatican City itself , which has a speed limit of 30 \u00a0 km / h ( 18 - 19 \u00a0 mph ) and approximately only 1000 cars ; but there were over 35 million deaths resulting from car accidents in the 20th century , and the Vatican is responding . In the same section of the document as the Drivers ' Ten Commandments are the so - called Christian virtues of drivers , which include prudence , justice and hope . The Guidelines not only deal with problems on the road , but also address prostitution , caring for street children and the homeless , found in Parts Two , Three and Four of the Guidelines . The Guidelines state that driving can bring out primitive behavior in drivers , which leads to road rage , rude gestures , speeding , drinking behind the wheel , cursing , blasphemy , impoliteness , and intentional violation of the highway code . The Guidelines encourage drivers to obey the highway code , pray behind the wheel and recite the rosary , which the Guidelines insist would not distract the driver 's attention . ",

    "text": "LEC billing is a form of billing for Internet - based or other usually electronic services where the user is charged through his account with the local telephone company ( also known as the local exchange carrier or LEC ) , rather than directly from the provider of the service . LEC billing is permitted in the United States as the breakup of the Bell System forced local telcos out of the long distance business ; each client would otherwise receive multiple monthly bills ( one for local service , one for long distance ) . There is no LEC billing for alternate long distance carriers in Canada as Bell Canada and Telus remain in the long - distance business and do not collect on behalf of their competitors . The LEC billing system is subject to abuse by vendors . Cramming is a form of phone fraud in which a third - party vendor adds unauthorised charges to a subscriber 's local telephone bill . ",

    "text": "The Toyota Avalon is a full - size car produced by Toyota in the United States , and is Toyota 's largest front - wheel - drive sedan in the United States , Canada , Puerto Rico , and the Middle East . It was also produced in Australia from April 2000 until June 2005 , when it was replaced in November 2006 by the Toyota Aurion . The first production Avalon rolled off the TMMK assembly line in Georgetown , Kentucky , in September 1994 . A second - generation model was released in the United States and Japan in 1999 . Toyota marketed the Avalon as a replacement for the Toyota Cressida , a model discontinued for the American market in 1992 . While the Cressida was an upper - level midsize rear - wheel - drive car with a straight - six engine , the Avalon is front - wheel - drive , powered by a V6 engine . In recent years , there has been considerable overlapping with its platform mates , the Toyota Camry V6 and the Lexus ES , although the third - generation Avalon was distinguished by offering extra legroom . For its fourth generation , the Avalon was introduced on a platform that is shared with the Lexus ES . As of 2013 , the Toyota Avalon is available in the United States , Canada , Puerto Rico , South Korea , and the Middle East . Avalon is a legendary island featured in the Arthurian legend , fitting it in with Toyota 's tradition of naming their sedans the word for \" crown \" in various languages ( Crown , Corona , Camry , Corolla ) , types of crowns ( Tiara ) , or other things associated with royalty ( Scepter ) .

The greater Los Angeles metro area has several notable art museums including the Los Angeles County Museum of Art ( LACMA ) , the J. Paul Getty Museum on the Santa Monica mountains overlooking the Pacific , the Museum of Contemporary Art ( MOCA ) , the Hammer Museum and the Norton Simon Museum . In the 1920s and 1930s Will Durant and Ariel Durant , Arnold Schoenberg and other intellectuals were the representatives of culture , in addition to the movie writers and directors . As the city flourished financially in the middle of the 20th century , culture followed . Boosters such as Dorothy Buffum Chandler and other philanthropists raised funds for the establishment of art museums , music centers and theaters . Today , the Southland cultural scene is as complex , sophisticated and varied as any in the world . ",

He sailed at the service of Castile in the fleet of Ferdinand Magellan , but deserted the expedition before reaching the Strait of Magellan , and returned to Spain in May 1521 . In 1524 he explored present - day Nova Scotia sailing South along the Maine coast . While historical accounts vary , Gomes may have entered New York Harbor and seen the Hudson River . Because of his expedition , the 1529 Diogo Ribeiro world map outlines the East coast of North America almost perfectly . ",

    "text": "Abdul Jabar Sabet is an Afghan politician . In May 2006 Hamid Karzai appointed him Attorney General of Afghanistan . Sabet is an ethnic Pashtun . Sabet was a long time aide to former Afghan Prime Minister Gulbuddin Hekmatyar . After leaving Afghanistan , he worked in the U.S. for Voice of America . After living in Montreal , Sabet returned to Afghanistan to work for a human rights organization , before being appointed special adviser at the Interior Ministry . He was promoted to Attorney General in May 2006 . Sources close to the President Hamid Karzai say that Sabet was promoted with U.S. support in exchange for giving positive comments about the Guantanamo Bay detention facility . He has however been critical of the Guantanamo release policy . A series of articles on former Guantanamo captives , published by the McClatchy News Service , quoted Sabet commenting that the release of Guantanamo captives seemed to be divorced from the captives ' role in the Taliban , and to be focussed largely on whether the captives complied with the camp rules . In April 2007 , Sabet launched a violent raid on Tolo TV ( the country 's largest private TV chain ) for what he thought was a \" distorted \" report on his comments regarding the country 's judicial system . Seven journalists from the TV station were taken to his office by force without warrants and severely beaten . ",

At the time it was simply to give additional training to NCOs likely to enter the officer corps . In 1918 , following the First World War , the school moved to Versailles and diversified by including in its ranks officers from other armies . It was not until 1937 that the school was given a flag . This emblem was officially handed over to the chef de corps , Colonel Picot , 14 July 1937 , on the Champs - \u00c9lys\u00e9es by the President Albert Lebrun . During the Second World War , the school moved to Pau then back to Paris before finding its current home in the Augereau barracks in Melun on 1 October 1945 . ",

    "text": "The Exe estuary is an estuary on the south coast of Devon , England . The estuary starts just to the south ( ) of the city of Exeter , and extends south for approximately eight miles to meet the English Channel ( ) . The estuary is a ria and so is larger than would be the case given the size of the River Exe , the main river feeding into the estuary . On the east shore ( from north to south ) are the town of Topsham , the villages of Exton and Lympstone and at the estuary mouth , the seaside resort of Exmouth . Opposite Exmouth on the west shore is the village of Dawlish Warren with its sand spit extending across the mouth of the estuary . Above this there are fewer settlements on the west shore , with just the villages of Starcross and Cockwood , both adjoining the lower portion of the estuary . The River Clyst also feeds into the estuary , just below Topsham . The River Kenn feeds into the estuary near Kenton . The soil is alluvial , derived from Devonian , Carboniferous and Permian rocks .

The story elucidates Bukowski 's publicly acknowledged artistic debt to Ernest Hemingway , the writer who had the most influence on American writers of Bukowksi 's generation . Like \" The Killers \" , Bukowski 's story of the same name has as its thematic trope Murder in a nihilistic universe . Unlike Hemingway , the killers actually accomplish their act in the time - frame of the story . Bukowski 's authorial point of view in his version of \" The Killers \" also is influenced by Hemingway , as he it be seen as a logical outgrowth of the attitude expressed by Hemingway 's fictional alter - ego Nick Adams at the end of the 1927 \" Killers \" : Bukowski 's fiction is full of attempts to escape the Los Angeles of his childhood and teen - years , all of which are doomed to failure as his fictional alter - ego , Henry Chinaski , finds the same appalling corruption everywhere he travels . In Bukowski 's \" The Killers \" , there is no escape for the murderers who are the protagonists of the story , mirroring the doomed boxer Ole Andreson in Hemingway 's original . ",

There have been claims made that the novel was written by mystery writer Craig Rice but others have suggested that there is enough documented evidence in the form of manuscripts and correspondence to prove Lee wrote at least a large portion if not the whole of the novel herself under the tutelage of editor / friend George Davis with some essential guidance from her good friend Rice . The novel has also been published under the titles Lady of Burlesque and The Strip - Tease Murders . Set in a burlesque theater , Lee casts herself as the detective who solves a set of homicides in which strippers in her troupe are found strangled with their own G - strings . In 2005 , Feminist Press of the City University of New York republished the book as one of its Women Write Pulp series . ",

    "text": "Appenzell is a village , a statistic town , but not a municipality , and the capital of the canton of Appenzell Innerrhoden in Switzerland . Appenzell has no municipal government of its own ; rather , the different parts of Appenzell belong to and are governed by the districts ( and municipalities ) Appenzell , Schwende and R\u00fcte . Because of that , for firefighting , energy and water , the village Appenzell has a special - purpose municipality , the Feuerschaugemeinde . In 1071 the village was referred to as Abbacella . By 1223 this changed to Abbatiscella , meaning the Abbot 's cell . This refers to the abbot of the Abbey of Saint Gall . The official language of Appenzell is ( the Swiss variety of Standard ) German , but the main spoken language is the local variant of the Alemannic Swiss German dialect . The buildings in the village core , the parish church , the 1563 town hall , the Salesis house , the ruins of Castle Clanx and the state archives with the administration building are listed as heritage sites of national significance .

    "text": "\" Burns Verkaufen der Kraftwerk \" ( ) is the eleventh episode of The Simpsons ' third season . It first aired on the Fox network in the United States on December 5 , 1991 . In the episode , Mr. Burns wishes to pursue other interests and therefore decides to sell his power plant to two German investors for $ 100 million . Safety inspector Homer is immediately fired by the Germans because of his incompetence . Later , Burns realizes that he has lost all his respectability because he can no longer control anyone . The episode was written by Jon Vitti and directed by Mark Kirkland . Originally , the writers wanted to have Burns sell the plant to the Japanese , but they decided that it would have been too clich\u00e9d ; the plot , however , remained the same with the Germans . The title is an inaccurate German translation of \" Burns sells the power plant \" , the correct version being Burns verkauft das Kraftwerk . In its original airing on the Fox network , the episode had a 12.6 Nielsen rating , finishing the week ranked 38th . \" Burns Verkaufen der Kraftwerk \" received generally positive reviews from critics and was praised for several scenes , particularly the \" Land of Chocolate \" sequence in which Homer dances around in an imaginary land made entirely out of chocolate . The sequence was also remade in cutscenes from the episode in The Simpsons Game . ",

    "text": "Western Ukraine or West Ukraine ( ) is a geographical and historical relative term used in reference to the western territories of Ukraine . It includes several actual historical regions such as Transcarpathia , Halychyna including Pokuttia , most of Volhynia , northern Bukovina as well as western Podolia . Less often it includes territories of eastern Volhynia , Podolia , and small portion of northern Bessarabia ( eastern part of Chernivtsi Oblast ) . Important cities are Buchach , Chernivtsi , Drohobych , Halych ( hence - Halychyna ) , Ivano - Frankivsk , Khotyn , Lutsk , Lviv , Mukacheve , Rivne , Ternopil , Uzhhorod and others . Western Ukraine is not an administrative category within Ukraine . It is defined mainly in the context of European history pertaining to the 20th - century wars and the ensuing period of annexations . At the onset of World War II the whole territory was incorporated into the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic ( \u0423\u0420\u0421\u0420 ) , following elections which are acknowledged as staged and specifically for the purpose to manufactured public consent for the transfer of land from occupied Poland to the Soviet Union as of October 22 , 1939 . Its historical background makes Western Ukraine uniquely different from the rest of the country , and contributes to its distinctive character of today . ",

Mais foresaw the defining power of the Rasta movement to Jamaican society 20 years before the era of Bob Marley and Reggae mainstream . It is also significant as an exploration of life in the ghetto of Kingston . It shows how the people relate to leaders , both making them deities and throwing them away when they fail to entertain them . The novel is written in prose with a layout that is seemingly cinematic and episodic ; little is done to describe the environment beyond the claustrophobic ghetto of ' The Lane ' in the slums of Kingston , Jamaica .

    "text": "Beyond Good & Evil is a 2003 action - adventure video game developed and published by Ubisoft for the PlayStation 2 , Microsoft Windows , Xbox and GameCube platforms . The story follows the adventures of Jade , an investigative reporter and martial artist , who works with a resistance movement to reveal a planet - wide alien conspiracy . The player controls Jade and allies , solving puzzles , fighting enemies , and obtaining photographic evidence . Michel Ancel , creator of the Rayman series , envisioned the game as the first part of a trilogy . The game was developed under the codename \" Project BG&E ; \" by 30 Ubisoft Pictures employees with production lasting more than three years . One of the main goals of the game is to create a meaningful story while giving players lots of freedom , though the game adopts a relatively linear structure . The game was received poorly when it was shown at E3 2002 , and it prompted the developers to change some of the game 's elements , including Jade 's design . Ancel also attempted to streamline the game in order to make the game more commercially appealing . Beyond Good & Evil was critically acclaimed . Critics praised the game 's animation , setting , story , and design , but criticized the game 's combat and technical issues . The game received a nomination for \" Game of the Year \" at the 2004 Game Developers Choice Awards . While the game had a cult following , it was considered a commercial failure at launch . A full HD re - mastered version of the game was released on Xbox Live Arcade in March 2011 and on PlayStation Network in June 2011 . A prequel , Beyond Good and Evil 2 , is in development and was announced at E3 2017 . ",

The \" falls \" from which Klamath Falls derives its name , and which in reality are best described as rapids rather than falls , are visible a short distance below the dam , though the water flow is generally insufficient to provide water flow over the rocks . The Klamath River begins at the narrow southern end of Lake Ewauna and flows from there to the Pacific Ocean . Before settlers came to the Klamath Basin , the Link River was known to the local Klamaths as Yulalona , meaning \" back and forth . \" At times , strong winds blew the water upstream into Klamath Lake and partly drained the riverbed . After its founding in 1867 , Klamath Falls was originally named Linkville . The name was changed to Klamath Falls in 1892 \u2013 93 . ",

    "text": "The Young Wild Things Tour was a four - band fall 2007 arena concert tour by Fall Out Boy with supporting acts Gym Class Heroes , Plain White T 's , Cute Is What We Aim For , and Doug ( from November 9 on ) . This is Fall Out Boy 's biggest tour to date , grossing over $ 30 million . The tour sold out in five hours , with over 1.5 million tickets sold . The tour was first announced on the Fall Out Boy website , but instead of the traditional method of announcing tour dates in the same release as the announcement of the tour itself , the bands chose an unusual method . Fans would text a certain number and would be given a code for their state / area . That code would then be entered on a website . After an unknown amount of codes were entered , the tour date would be unlocked . The 31-date tour was only held in America , except for two Canadian dates . The tour began on October 18 and ran through December 2 . Inspired by Maurice Sendak 's 1963 children 's book Where the Wild Things Are , the concert tour included sets designed by artist Rob Dobi , containing images from the book . Fall Out Boy bassist Pete Wentz explained , \" Where the Wild Things Are is a great narrative . It encapsulates pretty much every FOB song ever written : You know , tantrums and monster islands and all . \" \" There 's also a play on words of the young wild thing idea that everybody has with Hollywood and starlets right now . \" ",

Bonatti was advisor of Frederick II , Holy Roman Emperor , Ezzelino da Romano III , Guido Novello da Polenta and Guido I da Montefeltro . He also served the communal governments of Florence , Siena and Forl\u00ec . His employers were all Ghibellines ( supporters of the Holy Roman Emperor ) , who were in conflict with the Guelphs ( supporters of the Pope ) , and all were excommunicated at some time or another . Bonatti 's astrological reputation was also criticised in Dante 's Divine Comedy , where he is depicted as residing in hell as punishment for his astrology . His most famous work was his Liber Astronomiae or ' Book of Astronomy ' , written around 1277 . This remained a classic astrology textbook for two centuries . ",

Finnegan unsuccessfully sought the Democratic nomination for the position of a Chicago municipal court judge in 1939 . In 1960 , Finnegan was elected to Congress from Illinois ' 12th district . After redistricting , Finnegan 's district was merged with the neighboring 9th District of fellow Democrat Sidney Yates . Finnegan transferred to the 9th , since Yates was giving up his seat to run for the United States Senate . Yates lost , and Chicago 's machine bosses persuaded Finnegan to stand down in 1964 and hand the 9th back to Yates . In return for his co - operation , Finnegan was appointed as a judge for the Circuit Court of Cook County . He resigned his seat in Congress on December 6 , 1964 and commenced his service on the bench the following day . He continued to serve until his death in 1971 . ",

The Quinnipiac and Mill rivers converge and empty into the inlet on its north end . The Pearl Harbor Memorial Bridge crosses here . The West River empties into the western end of the harbor ( also known as West Haven Harbor ) . The harbor is protected from Long Island Sound by a peninsula on its eastern side , once known as \" Little Necke \" but now called Lighthouse Point , because of the lighthouse that was constructed on its tip in 1805 . The original lighthouse was replaced in 1845 by the current structure , called the Five Mile Point Lighthouse . This lighthouse was replaced for navigation in 1877 by the offshore Southwest Ledge Light . Sperry Lighthouse ( 1899 \u2013 1933 ) also served the harbor . In July 1779 , during the American Revolutionary War , the peninsula was the scene of an amphibious landing by British troops . The harbor is circumnavigable via the partially completed \" Harborside Greenway \" bicycle and pedestrian trail , which is part of the East Coast Greenway system . ",

His first story appeared in 1903 , but then the writer lapsed into a long pause before returning to writing in the early 1920s . His recalcitrance to the Soviet ideological pressure cost him life : he was executed during the Great Purge and his writings were banned for nearly twenty years . In the words of the modern British scholar of Russian and Georgian literature , Donald Rayfield , \" his vivid story - telling , straight in medias res , his buoyant humour , subtle irony , and moral courage merit comparison with those of Stendhal , Guy de Maupassant , and \u00c9mile Zola .

    "text": "Antisemitic canards are unfounded rumors or false allegations which are defamatory towards Judaism as a religion , or defamatory towards Jews as an ethnic or religious group . They often form part of broader theories of Jewish conspiracies . According to defense attorney Kenneth Stern , \" Historically , Jews have not fared well around conspiracy theories . Such ideas fuel anti - Semitism . The myths that all Jews are responsible for the death of Christ , or poisoned wells , or killed Christian children to bake matzos , or \" made up \" the Holocaust , or plot to control the world , do not succeed each other ; rather , the list of anti - Semitic canards gets longer . \" Some antisemitic canards date back to the birth of Christianity , while some conspiracy theories are more recent . Since at least the Middle Ages , antisemitism has featured elements of conspiracy theory . In medieval Europe it was widely believed that Jews poisoned wells , had been responsible for the death of Jesus , and ritually consumed the blood of Christians . The second half of the 19th century saw the emergence of notions that Jews and/or Freemasons were plotting to establish control over the world . Forged evidence has been presented to spread the notion that Jews were responsible for the propagation of Communism , the most notorious example being The Protocols of the Elders of Zion ( 1903 ) . Such antisemitic conspiracy theories became central to the worldview of Adolf Hitler . Antisemitic theories persist today in notions concerning banking , Hollywood , the news media and a purported Zionist Occupation Government . Holocaust denial is also considered an antisemitic conspiracy theory because of its position that the Holocaust is a hoax designed to advance the interests of Jews and justify the creation of the State of Israel .

    "text": "Between Five and Seven is as the name suggests , the sixth studio album by folk singer - songwriter John Gorka . It was released in August 1996 . It is the last of the five albums Gorka recorded for Windham Hill / High Street Records before returning to the smaller , Red House label . Gorka produced the album with John Jennings who also produced Gorka 's previous record , Out of the Valley . Unlike the previous record made in Nashville , Tennessee , the recording was done at Paisley Park Studios , Chanhassen , Minnesota and the instrumentation has been described as \" more acoustic , less pop - oriented . \" Paisley Park is southwest of Minneapolis and is the studio designed and owned by the artist , Prince . The album includes several lyrical portraits of Gorka 's misfit characters , love songs , and philosophical musings . The songs are also full of the wordplay for which Gorka has become known . The album features an impressive array of supporting musicians . Lucy Kaplansky and Jennifer Kimball add carefully placed harmony vocals to many tracks . John Jennings also brings along several other members of Mary Chapin Carpenter 's band including drummer Robbie Magruder , guitarist Dean Magraw , and pianist Jonathan Carroll . Gorka 's fellow Minnesotan Peter Ostroushko sits in on mandolin . As with many of Gorkas recordings Michael Manring plays fretless bass on nearly half of the songs . The tracks alternate between two different sets of instrumentalists which varies the pace of the music . The two bass players styles are distinct enough for the listener to recognize the difference .

    "text": "Elizabeth II was Queen of Mauritius from 1968 to 1992 . Mauritius was a constitutional monarchy with Elizabeth as head of state . The Queen was also the monarch of the United Kingdom and the other Commonwealth realms . Her constitutional roles in Mauritius were delegated to a Governor - General . The Parliament of the United Kingdom 's Mauritius Independence Act 1968 transformed the British Crown Colony of Mauritius into an independent sovereign state . Unusually , no member of the British royal family attended the independence ceremony on the island because of security concerns . Princess Alexandra was due to attend but after communal violence the British Minister of State for the Commonwealth , Lord Shepherd , advised that her visit be cancelled . The Queen and her husband Prince Philip , Duke of Edinburgh , visited Mauritius for three days ( 24\u201326 March ) in 1972 , as part of a tour of Asia and Africa . They arrived in Port Louis on the royal yacht Britannia after visiting the Seychelles . They were met by a crowd of nearly a quarter of a million people , and rode through the city in an open - topped car . During the visit , the Queen opened the sixth session of the third Mauritius Parliament . The royal couple left Mauritius for Nairobi by air . It was the first ever visit to the island by a reigning monarch . Mauritius became a republic within the Commonwealth in 1992 with the President of Mauritius replacing the Queen as head of state . To date , Mauritius is the most recent of the Queen 's realms to become a republic . ",

There are certain criteria that must be met prior to entering information into the NIBIN database . For instance , cartridge cases from a .22 caliber firearm or a revolver are normally not entered . Using NIBIN , law enforcement staff can identify firearms in new cases that were used in prior incidents . A series of seventeen different Washington state crime scenes involving seven firearms , and three different agencies in two counties , was identified using information provided by IBIS / NIBIN . ",

    "text": "Franz Wilhelm Seiwert ( March 9 , 1894 \u2013 July 3 , 1933 ) was a German painter and sculptor in a constructivist style . He was also politically active as a communist making significant contributions , both graphic and theoretical to Die Aktion . Seiwert was born in Cologne . He was seriously burned in 1901 , at the age of seven , in an experimental radiological treatment . As a result , he subsequently lived with the fear that his life would be short . He studied from 1910 to 1914 at the Cologne School of Arts and Crafts . In 1919 he met Max Ernst and took part in Dada activities . He was invited to exhibit in the large Dada exhibit in Cologne but withdrew at the last moment . In that same year he formed the Stupid group which included Heinrich Hoerle and Anton R\u00e4derscheidt . According to Ernst , \" Stupid was a secession from Cologne Dada . As far as Hoerle and especially Seiwert were concerned , Dada 's activities were aesthetically too radical and socially not concrete enough \" . His first large solo exhibition was in Cologne at the Kunstverein in 1923 , and by the mid-1920s he was a leader of the \" Group of Progressive Artists \" , who sought to reconcile constructivism with realism while expressing radical political views . In 1929 he founded the magazine \" a - z \" , a journal of progressive art . This became a vehicle for the exposition of Figurative Constructivism . ",

The engagement was part of Prince Eugene of Savoy 's campaign to seize the Spanish controlled Duchy of Milan in the Italian peninsula , and had followed his victory over Marshal Catinat at the Battle of Carpi in July . Marshal Villeroi replaced Catinat as commander of the Franco \u2013 Spanish \u2013 Savoyard forces in the theatre , carrying with him orders from King Louis XIV to push the Imperialists out of Italy . Foreseeing Villeroi 's intention of attacking at any price , Eugene entrenched himself in front of the small fortress of Chiari , and waited for the attack . In a battle that lasted several hours the Austrians inflicted heavy casualties on Villeroi 's forces , gaining an overwhelming victory . The campaign established Eugene in Lombardy , and helped to persuade the Maritime Powers to come to the aid of the Emperor . Within a week of the battle England , the Dutch Republic , and Leopold I , had signed the second treaty of the Grand Alliance . ",

    "text": "Tomcats Screaming Outside is the first ( and to date only ) solo album from British musician Roland Orzabal of the group Tears for Fears , and was released on 2 April 2001 . Although Orzabal had effectively made two solo albums under the Tears for Fears moniker in the 1990s ( following the departure of bandmate Curt Smith ) , this was the first recording to be released under his own name . This album was Orzabal 's last to feature contributions from Alan Griffiths , who co - wrote most of the tracks on this album as well as the previous two Tears for Fears albums . The album was given a low - key release and did not chart , but earned some critical acclaim for its clever melding of pop songwriting and drum ' n bass , ambient techno and trip hop textures . Dan Gennoe claimed in Amazon.com 's editorial review : \" Solo album or not , Tomcats Screaming Outside is the best Tears for Fears album in a decade . \" In a 2000 interview Orzabal commented on his influences for the album : \" I started out with an absolute concrete vision of where I wanted to go so I started with a very different rhythm approach , with drum and bass / jungle ... and I ended up with something that was n't the original plan . \" The US release of the album ( on Gold Circle Records ) had the unfortunate coincidence to be released on September 11 , 2001 the same day the United States experienced its worst - ever terrorist attack , and drew little notice outside TFF 's core fan base .

The bill was sponsored by Senator Robert F. Wagner ( D - N.Y. ) and Rep. Edith Rogers ( R - Mass . ) in the wake of the 1938 Kristallnacht attacks on Jews in Germany . The bill was introduced to Congress on February 9 , 1939 . The bill had widespread support among religious and labor groups , but was opposed by nationalist organizations . It never came to a vote because it was blocked by Senator Robert Rice Reynolds of North Carolina , who held a powerful position because of his seniority . Reynolds was an anti - Semite and Anglophobe who was among those whose support President Roosevelt needed for American rearmament . ",

    "text": "The Burseraceae are a moderate - sized family of 17 - 19 genera and about 540 species of flowering plants . The actual numbers differ according to the time period in which a given source is written describing this family . The Burseraceae are also known as the torchwood family , the frankincense and myrrh family , or simply the incense tree family . The family includes both trees and shrubs , and is native to tropical regions of Africa , Asia , and the Americas . Just as the family size ( in terms of genera and species ) differs according to the time period of the study , so , too , does its placement in the higher ranks . Nevertheless , the family is a genetically supported monophyletic group currently and frequently cited within the Sapindales and is recognized as a sister group to the Anacardiaceae . The Burseraceae are characterized by the nonallergenic resin they produce in virtually all plant tissue and the distinctive smooth , yet flaking , aromatic bark . The origins of the family can be traced to the Paleocene ( about 65 Mya ) when Beiselia mexicana first diverged in Mexico . The subsequent divergences in the family lineage and migration of the species in the Eocene ( 53 Mya ) from North America have led to the current distributions of the species that are primarily associated with the tropics . Though the family likely originated in North America , the greatest generic diversity presently is in the Southern Hemisphere . Tabonuco ( Dacryodes excelsa ) and gumbo limbo ( Bursera simaruba ) represent the economic , ethnobotanical , and ecological significance of the Burseraceae in the Western Hemisphere , while frankincense ( Boswellia sacra ) and myrrh ( Commiphora myrrha ) represent the same in the Eastern Hemisphere .

It was written by Richard Appel and directed by Steven Dean Moore . The episode sees Apu Nahasapeemapetilon marry Manjula , and incorporates several aspects of Hindu wedding ceremonies , which the writers researched during the episode 's production . Appel pitched the episode several years before season nine but the idea was not used until Mike Scully became showrunner . The episode 's subplot , which sees Homer stay at the Springfield Retirement Castle , was initially conceived as a separate episode , but could not be developed in enough detail . The episode received mixed reviews . ",

    "text": "The Pleistocene coyote ( Canis latrans orcutti ) , also known as the Ice Age coyote , is an extinct subspecies of coyote that lived in western North America during the Late Pleistocene era . Most remains of the subspecies were found in southern California , though at least one was discovered in Idaho . It was part of a carnivore guild that included other canids like foxes , gray wolves , and dire wolves . Compared to their modern Holocene counterparts , Pleistocene coyotes were larger and more robust , weighing , likely in response to larger competitors and prey rather than Bergmann 's rule . Their skulls and jaws were significantly thicker and deeper than in modern coyotes , with a shorter and broader rostrum and wider carnassial ( denoting the large upper premolar and lower molar teeth of a carnivore , adapted for shearing flesh ) teeth . These adaptions allowed it to cope with higher levels of stress , when it killed larger prey , compared to modern coyotes . Pleistocene coyotes were also likely more specialized carnivores than their descendants , as their teeth were more adapted to shearing meat , showing fewer grinding surfaces which were better suited for processing vegetation . The lower jaw was also deeper , and the molars showed more signs of wear and breakage than modern populations , thus indicating that the animals consumed more bone than today . Behaviorally , it is likely to have been more social than the modern coyote , as its remains are the third most common in the La Brea Tar Pits , after dire wolves and sabre - toothed cats , both thought to be gregarious species . Their reduction in size occurred within 1,000 years of the occurrence of the Quaternary extinction event , when the climate changed and the majority of their larger prey became extinct . Furthermore , Pleistocene coyotes were unable to successfully exploit the big game hunting niche left vacant after the extinction of the dire wolf , as that gap was rapidly filled by gray wolves . These gray wolves are likely to have actively killed off the larger - bodied coyotes , with natural selection favoring the modern gracile morph . Human predation on the Pleistocene coyote 's dwindling prey base may have also impacted the animal 's change in morphology . ",

Dreyfus joined a small textile trading firm set up by three of his elder brothers and moved to Lima , Peru to act as their local representative . He became involved in the guano trade , and in 1869 signed a major contract with the Peruvian government that gave him a monopoly over exports of Peruvian guano to Europe . With this he controlled the largest source of Peruvian national income . The Peruvian government let Dreyfus act as their agent in managing their existing debt and floating new loans used for railway construction . The government ran into increasing financial difficulties . These were compounded by a war with Chile between 1879 and 1883 in which they lost their key guano - producing province . A lengthy series of lawsuits followed between the creditors whose loans were secured by guano deposits and the governments of Peru and Chile . The Dreyfus trading enterprise came to an end . He retired to France , where he owned a chateau in the country and a mansion in Paris that he filled with a major collection of art . ",

Published in 1950 , the manifesto paved the way for the government - controlled Three - Self Patriotic Movement ( TSPM ) of Protestants . This movement proclaimed the three principles of self - government , self - support , and self - propagation . The drafting and content of the manifesto was , and remains , controversial to this day . The manifesto was devised after Protestant leaders presented their concerns with religious freedom to Zhou Enlai , the Premier of China . Instead of receiving their report , Zhou demanded them to come up with a statement in support of the new communist leadership . Y. T. Wu and other leftist clergymen espoused the task and presented a draft manifesto that , after some opposition and changes , became a foundational text of Christianity in the new People 's Republic . It condemns missionary activities in China as a form of imperialism , pledges loyalty to the communist leadership , and encourages the Church to take up an indigenous Chinese stance toward Christianity . Published on the front page of the People 's Daily , the manifesto was accompanied by a campaign to gather signatures . Many Christian leaders and laymen signed , while others refused to do so . After the Korean War broke out , the campaign became an increasingly politicized test of loyalty that became merged with the Campaign to Suppress Counterrevolutionaries . Some view the manifesto as a betrayal of the Church , while others find sympathy for the position of Chinese Christians struggling to reconcile their faith with the changed political realities . The manifesto ended missionary activities in China and the separation of church and state . It led to the founding the TSPM and brought persecution to dissidents . ",

The lake and park have a fishing dock , wading pool , tennis courts , and softball diamonds . There is a recreation center that hosts activities . The lake borders a municipal golf course . In the winter the park sets up ice and hockey rinks . There is a bike and walking path starting at Lake Hiawatha which veers onto Lake Nokomis or winds down the Minnehaha Creek right to the mouth of the Minnehaha Falls . Lake Hiawatha is one of the few lakes through which Minnehaha Creek flows , and the last one before it reaches Minnehaha Falls and then the Mississippi River . Friends of Lake Hiawatha is a community environmental action group that organizes volunteer efforts to clean the lake and park . ",

    "text": "The Scribe is a 1966 comedy film short starring Buster Keaton in his last film role before his death from lung cancer on February 1 , 1966 . It was produced by the Construction Safety Association of Ontario , Canada to promote Construction site safety , and was filmed where the Ontario Government Buildings were under construction in Toronto . The director was John Sebert . Keaton portrays the janitor at a newspaper who accidentally intercepts a call from the editor , ordering him to do a story about safety practices at a massive construction site . He sneaks onto the construction site and finds a list of 16 safety rules posted on a wall . He takes the list and attempts to confront workers when he sees them acting in an unsafe manner , often causing more accidents than he prevents . Keaton is silent throughout the film as he recreates several routines from his youth . Most notable was his recreation of a gag from his 1918 film The Bell Boy in which he mops the floor using only the tip of the mop , little by little while sitting on the floor . ",

    "text": "The Ninety - Two Resolutions were drafted by Louis - Joseph Papineau and other members of the Parti patriote of Lower Canada in 1834 . The resolutions were a long series of demands for political reforms in the British - governed colony . Papineau had been elected speaker of the legislative assembly of Lower Canada in 1815 . His party constantly opposed the unelected colonial government , and in 1828 he helped draft an early form of the resolutions , essentially a list of grievances against the colonial administration . To ensure that the views of the Legislative Assembly be understood by the British House of Commons , the Parti patriote had sent its own delegation to London in order to submit a memoir and a petition signed by 87,000 people . On February 28 , 1834 , Papineau presented the Ninety - Two Resolutions to the Legislative Assembly which were approved and sent to London . The resolutions included , among other things , demands for an elected Legislative Council and an Executive Council responsible before the house of representatives . Under the Constitutional Act of 1791 , the government of Lower Canada was given an elected legislative assembly , but members of the upper houses were appointed by the Governor of the colony . In the resolutions , the elected representatives once again reiterated their loyalty to the British Crown , but expressed frustration that the government of London had been unwilling to correct the injustices caused by the past governments of the colony . Papineau 's resolutions were ignored for almost three years ; meanwhile , the Legislative Assembly did all it could to oppose the un - elected upper houses while avoiding outright rebellion . British Colonial Secretary Lord Russell eventually responded to them by issuing ten resolutions of his own ( the Russell Resolutions ) . All of the Legislative Assembly 's demands were rejected . The ten resolutions reached Canada in 1837 , and many of Papineau 's reformists began to agitate for a rebellion . See the Lower Canada Rebellion . ",

Perkis and Bischoff modified their equipment for a performance at The Network Muse Festival in 1986 at The LAB in San Francisco . Instead of creating an ad - hoc wired connection of computer interaction , they decided to use a hub - a general purpose connection for network data . This was less failure - prone and enabled greater collaborations . The Hub was the first band to do a telematic performance in 1987 at the Clocktower in New York . Since this work represents some of the earliest work in the context of the new live music practice of Networked music performance , they have been cited as the archetypal network ensemble in computer music . The Hub 's best - known piece , Stuck Note by Scot Gresham - Lancaster has been covered by a number of network music bands , including MiLO- the Milwaukee Laptop Orchestra and BiLE- the Birmingham Laptop Ensemble . They have collaborated with Rova Saxophone Quartet , Nick Collins , Phill Niblock , and Alvin Curran . They currently perform around the world after a multi - year hiatus , ending in 2004 . ",

The first Philippine Commission was appointed by President William McKinley on January 20 , 1899 to make recommendations . The second Philippine Commission , also known as the Taft Commission , was a body appointed by the President to exercise legislative and limited executive powers in the Philippines . It was first appointed by President McKinley in 1900 under his executive authority . The Philippine Organic Act was passed by the United States Congress in 1902 ; this enshrined into law the Commission 's legislative and executive authority . As stipulated in the Philippine Organic Act , the bicameral Philippine Legislature was established in 1907 , with the Commission as the upper house and the elected Philippine Assembly acting as lower house . The Jones Act of 1916 ended the Commission , replacing it with an elected Philippine Senate as the Legislature 's upper house . ",

It was a part of a larger policy of Russification pursued by late 19th \u2013 early 20th century Russian governments which tried to abolish cultural and administrative autonomy of non - Russian minorities within the empire . The two Russification campaigns evoked widespread Finnish resistance , starting with petitions and escalating to strikes , passive resistance ( including draft resistance ) and eventually active resistance . Finnish opposition to Russification was one of the main factors that ultimately led to Finland 's declaration of independence in 1917 . ",

    "text": "The northern bald ibis , hermit ibis , or waldrapp ( Geronticus eremita ) is a migratory bird found in barren , semi - desert or rocky habitats , often close to running water . This glossy black ibis , which , unlike many members of the ibis family , is non - wading , has an unfeathered red face and head , and a long , curved red bill . It breeds colonially on coastal or mountain cliff ledges , where it typically lays two to three eggs in a stick nest , and feeds on lizards , insects , and other small animals . The northern bald ibis was once widespread across the Middle East , northern Africa , southern and central Europe , with a fossil record dating back at least 1.8 \u00a0 million years . It disappeared from Europe over 300 years ago , and is now considered critically endangered . There are believed to be about 500 wild birds remaining in southern Morocco , and fewer than 10 in Syria , where it was rediscovered in 2002 . To combat this ebb in numbers , recent reintroduction programs have been instituted internationally , with a semi - wild breeding colony in Turkey , as well as sites in Austria , Spain , and northern Morocco . The reasons for the species ' long - term decline are unclear , but hunting , loss of foraging habitat , and pesticide poisoning have been implicated in the rapid loss of colonies in recent decades .

Since the new CBN law school would not initially be accredited ( and in fact did not receive provisional accreditation until 1989 ) , students graduating in spring 1987 were allowed to state they graduated from Coburn , in order to be listed as graduating from an accredited school .

His imprisonment drew protest from the US State Department and Amnesty International , the latter of which named him a prisoner of conscience . Mich\u00e1 was active with the Progress Party of Equatorial Guinea ( PPGE ) , a banned political party opposing the long - dominant Democratic Party of Equatorial Guinea . In late March 2008 , he was arrested without a warrant . Within a week , fellow PPGE activists Cruz Obiang Ebele , Gumersindo Ram\u00edrez Faustino , Juan Ecomo Ndong , Gerardo Ang\u00fce Mangue , and Bonifacio Nguema Ndong were also arrested . Mich\u00e1 was held for two months at the police station , turning which time he was allegedly tortured . In May 2008 , the six men were charged with knowledge of a weapons cache in the home of another PPGE activist , Saturnino Ncogo . Ncogo had died in prison on early March in suspicious circumstances . Authorities alleged he had thrown himself from the top bunk of his cell to commit suicide , but relatives received his body in an advanced state of decomposition , and no investigation was ever conducted . According to Amnesty International , the six men were given an unfair trial at which no evidence was presented save the weapons from Ncogo 's home and the statements the six had made under duress ; in addition , the six defendants alleged that police had altered their statements after the defendants had signed them . Despite being charged with unrelated crimes , the six were tried alongside Simon Mann , a UK national who had helped to organize a 2004 coup attempt . The six PPGE members were given sentences of one to five years apiece . The US State Department considers Mich\u00e1 a political prisoner , and has objected to his continued imprisonment . Amnesty International named him a prisoner of conscience , and has called for his immediate release . ",

    "text": "Elwood C. Buchanan , Sr was an American jazz trumpeter and teacher who became an early mentor of Miles Davis . Buchanan was born in St Louis , Missouri on January 26 , 1907 , and was trained in music by Joseph Gustat , the principal trumpeter with the St Louis Symphony Orchestra . He began his career playing in local dance bands , including Andy Kirk 's orchestra , and on the riverboats that travelled on the Mississippi River between St Louis and New Orleans . During the late 1930s and early 1940s , he taught music and directed the band at Lincoln High School in East St Louis , and also visited the local elementary schools to give weekly lessons . Buchanan was known for his strict and demanding teaching style , and for encouraging pupils to compete with one another . Buchanan was a patient of Miles Davis 's father , who told him of his son 's interest in music . Although Davis , at thirteen , was then too young to attend Buchanan 's school , Buchanan began giving him private lessons . Davis joined the school band when he began attending Lincoln . Although Buchanan had the band play mainly marches rather than jazz , the techniques he taught profoundly affected Davis ' jazz style . In particular , Buchanan went against the times by recommending to his students that they play without vibrato , and is said to have broken Davis of the habit by rapping his knuckles with a ruler and commanding : \" Stop shakin ' that note . You 're going to shake enough when you get old \" . Buchanan also encouraged Davis to study the lean , relaxed playing of Bobby Hackett ( then little known beyond the East Coast ) and Harold Shorty Baker . In this , too , Buchanan went against fashion ; the most popular trumpeter of the day was Louis Armstrong , whose hot playing style was very different from those of Hackett or Baker . Davis later credited Buchanan with persuading his parents to buy him a new trumpet , rather than a violin as his mother had preferred . Buchanan also introduced Davis to Clark Terry , who would become his recording partner . In his autobiography , Davis recalled : \" Mr. Buchanan was the biggest influence on my life up until then . He was definitely the person who took me all the way into music at that time . \" ",

    "text": "Consort Mei ( died 755 ) was an imperial consort of the Chinese dynasty Tang Dynasty during the reign of Emperor Xuanzong of Tang . She was one of Emperor Xuanzong 's favorite concubine , often known as Mei fei ( with fei being a standard rank for imperial consorts during her lifetime ) . Her actual name was Jiang Caipin ( \u6c5f\u91c7\u860b ) , originally called Consort Jiang . After being told by her that she greatly favored Plum - Blossom flowers ( the flower is pronounced as mei in Chinese ) , Emperor Xuanzong began to fondly address her as Consort Mei . Consort Mei was initially selected by Gao Lishi , an eunuch official of Emperor Xuanzong , to become one of Emperor Xuanzong 's concubines in his harem . As Consort Mei was the most literate and talented concubines , she soon obtained Xuanzong 's favors . To express the favors towards Consort Mei , Xuanzong commanded servants to plant Plum - Blossom trees all around her palace to please her interest . Xuanzong even lovingly complimented her beauty as more adorable than Zhao Feiyan , and swore that he would never change his heart for her . However , in 737 , after the death of Consort Wu , another favorite concubine of Xuanzong , Xuanzong was deeply depressed until Gao Lishi convinced him to try looking at Yang Yuhuan - the wife of prince Li Mao , Xuanzong son with Consort Wu since her beauty was described as the most \" irresistible \" . Being curious , Xuanzong ordered Yang Yuhuan to come and subsequently fell in love with her beauty . Since Yuhuan was still literally his daughter - in - law ( as she was Li Mao 's wife ) , emperor Xuanzong then stealthily arranged Yuhuan to become a Taoist nun , after a brief moment , Xuanzong eventually offered Yuhuan honorable title as Yang Guifei ( with Guifei being the highest rank for imperial consorts ) after bestowing his son Li Mao a new wife . Yuhuan became Xuanzong 's most beloved consort as Xuanzong soon forgot about Consort Wu 's death . His favors towards Consort Mei also waned . In 755 , An Lushan began to create a rebellion ( known as An Lushan Rebellion ) in the palace . Emperor Xuanzong decided to bring Yang Guifei and his cortege along to flee from the capital Chang'an to Chengdu . Consort Mei was left behind then murdered during the rebellion . ",

Most ambassadorships , however , are assigned to Foreign Service Officers who have spent their career in the State Department . Regardless , all ambassadors must be formally appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate . While all ambassadors serve at the president 's pleasure and may be dismissed at any time , career diplomats usually serve tours of roughly three years before receiving a new assignment , and political appointees customarily tender their resignations upon the inauguration of a new president .

The facility is currently under construction nearing completion . The naming of the sports complex was criticized by some Barbadians for being named after a Jamaican athlete , Usain Bolt instead of a Barbadian athlete . University principal , Sir Hilary Beckles said that the naming did not intend to marginalize Barbadian sportspeople and the decision was intended to be a move that meant to \" celebrate all West Indians \" .

    "text": "Edmund Burke (; 12 January [ NS ] 17309 July 1797 ) was an Irish statesman born in Dublin , as well as an author , orator , political theorist and philosopher , who after moving to London in 1750 served as a member of parliament ( MP ) between 1766 and 1794 in the House of Commons with the Whig Party . Burke was a proponent of underpinning virtues with manners in society and of the importance of religious institutions for the moral stability and good of the state . These views were expressed in his A Vindication of Natural Society . Burke criticized British treatment of the American colonies , including through its taxation policies . He also supported the rights of the colonists to resist metropolitan authority , though he opposed the attempt to achieve independence . Burke is remembered for his support for Catholic emancipation , the impeachment of Warren Hastings from the East India Company and for his staunch opposition to the French Revolution . In his Reflections on the Revolution in France , Burke asserted that the revolution was destroying the fabric of good society , traditional institutions of state and society and condemned the persecution of the Catholic Church that resulted from it . This led to his becoming the leading figure within the conservative faction of the Whig Party , which he dubbed the \" Old Whigs \" , as opposed to the pro - French Revolution \" New Whigs \" , led by Charles James Fox . In the nineteenth century , Burke was praised by both conservatives and liberals . Subsequently , in the twentieth century he became widely regarded as the philosophical founder of modern conservatism . ",

    "text": "TMF ( The Music Factory ) was a music video and entertainment channel in the United Kingdom and Ireland . The channel was owned by Viacom International Media Networks and was originally a Dutch channel . Formed after the two other TMF stations , which are based in mainland Europe , the channel was created to counter against EMAP 's The Hits channel ( now 4Music ) on the new free - to - air digital terrestrial television service Freeview in 2002 . Upon launch , TMF 's description was \" TMF is designed to replicate the rhythms of the whole family , playing the best pop videos with the biggest pop stars to become the sound track to the British family life . \" However , it had since broadened its content to show programmes from its sister channels MTV , VH1 , Nick Jr. and Comedy Central , so no longer relied on just music videos . TMF broadcast on Freeview , Sky and Virgin Media and as well as in some Irish cable packages . The channel was the most viewed music video related station in the UK , according to BARB ratings . TMF had a new look on screen graphics in March 2008 to match the other British MTV channels . The previous on screen graphics were used since July 2005 and the original on screen graphics were used since October 2002 . The original DOG was on the top right of the screen , it has been moved to the top left of the screen since July 2005 . The new look TMF still used the old pre-2007 TMF logo whereas both the Dutch and Belgian TMF channels adapted the new logo . The DOG on music programmes was TMF : Music . ",

It also reached number four in Canada and was a number - one hit on both the US and Canadian Adult Contemporary charts .

It was co - written by British singer Rob Fisher , formerly one half of the 1980s pop outfits Naked Eyes and Climie Fisher . To date , the song was Astley 's last appearance in the top 10 in either the US or UK . The song has been sung by Rick Astley in duet with Soren Sko and covered by Thomas Anders ( ex - Modern Talking ) . ",

    "text": "Marcial Maciel Degollado ( March 10 , 1920 \u2013 January 30 , 2008 ) was a Mexican Catholic priest who founded the Legion of Christ and the Regnum Christi movement , serving as general director of the legion from 1941 to 2005 . Throughout most of his career , he was respected within the church as \" the greatest fundraiser of the modern Roman Catholic church \" and as a prolific recruiter of new seminarians . Late in his life , Maciel was revealed to have sexually abused boys and young men . After his death , it came to light that he had also maintained relationships with at least two women , one of whom was a minor . He fathered as many as six children , and allegedly abused two of these children as well . In 2006 Pope Benedict XVI removed Maciel from active ministry based on the results of an investigation that he had started while head of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith , before his election as Pope in April 2005 . Maciel was ordered \" to conduct a reserved life of prayer and penance , renouncing every public ministry \" , and died in 2008 . On March 25 , 2010 , a communiqu\u00e9 on the legion 's website acknowledged as factual the \" reprehensible actions \" by Maciel , including sexual abuse of minor seminarians . In May 2010 the Vatican denounced Maciel 's actions and appointed a Papal Delegate to oversee the order and its governance . ",

Unlike with most European monarchies , his large regnal number does not indicate that he was preceded by seventy - one previous rulers also named Heinrich . By tradition , all male members of the House of Reuss are named Heinrich , and are numbered by order of birth within the family in general . In the Reuss Younger Line , the numbering system was reset at the beginning of each century ; thus Heinrich LXXII 's high number is directly related to his having been born at the very end of the eighteenth century . Heinrich LXXII abdicated in 1848 , due to civil unrest in connection with the revolutions that spread through Germany and elsewhere in Europe that year . The last of his branch of the family , his principality passed to the Prince Reuss zu Schleiz , unifying the lands of the Reuss Younger Line . ",

    "text": "Microserfs , published by HarperCollins in 1995 , is an epistolary novel by Douglas Coupland . It first appeared in short story form as the cover article for the January 1994 issue of Wired magazine and was subsequently expanded to full novel length . Set in the early 1990s , it captures the state of the technology industry before Windows 95 , and anticipates the dot - com bubble of the late 1990s . The novel is presented in the form of diary entries maintained on a PowerBook by the narrator , Daniel . Because of this , as well as its formatting and usage of emoticons , this novel is similar to what emerged a decade later as the blog format . Coupland revisited many of the ideas in Microserfs in his 2006 novel JPod , which has been labeled \" Microserfs for the Google generation \" . ",

    "text": "The Frente de Liberta\u00e7\u00e3o do Arquip\u00e9lago da Madeira ( ) , or FLAMA ( which could be read as an archaic Portuguese word for \" flame \" , flama ) , was a right - wing terrorist paramilitary organisation from Madeira , whose main goal was to achieve Madeira 's independence from mainland Portugal . FLAMA carried out more than 70 armed and bomb attacks between 1974 - 1976 , during the revolutionary period that followed the Portuguese Carnation Revolution ( April 25 , 1974 ) . The Carnation Revolution effectively changed the Portuguese regime from an authoritarian dictatorship ( the Estado Novo ) to a democracy ( the Third Republic ) , but only after two years of a transitional period known as PREC ( Processo Revolucion\u00e1rio Em Curso , Portuguese for Ongoing Revolutionary Process ) , characterized by social turmoil and power dispute between left and right wing political forces . During this period the new government withdrew from Angola and Mozambique , the last Portuguese colonies on mainland Africa . Some in Madeira thought that their area should be the next to separate . FLAMA 's demands were more a right - wing political reaction by some of the regional elites to the left - wing nature of the Revolution and its main actors , than a truly ethnic or nationalist separatist goal . After the normalization of the Portuguese political system , early in 1976 , and the constitutional grant of autonomy to the Portuguese North Atlantic archipelagos of Madeira and Azores ( where a similar organization existed , the Frente de Liberta\u00e7\u00e3o dos A\u00e7ores ) , the organization vanished . Allegedly one of FLAMA 's most important activists was the controversial Alberto Jo\u00e3o Jardim , the former President of the regional government of Madeira , co - founder of the Madeiran branch of the popular centre - right - wing Portuguese party PSD and former Vice - president of the European People 's Party .

The ridge is an important recreation resource located within of more than 1.5 million people , offering four long - distance hiking trails and over a dozen parks and recreation areas , including several historic sites . It has been the focus of ongoing conservation efforts because of its natural , historic , and recreational value , involving municipal , state , and national agencies and nearly two dozen non - profit organizations . The Metacomet Ridge extends from New Haven and Branford , Connecticut on Long Island Sound , through the Connecticut River Valley region of Massachusetts , to northern Franklin County , Massachusetts , short of the Vermont and New Hampshire borders for a distance of . It is geologically distinct from the nearby Appalachian Mountains and surrounding uplands , and is composed of volcanic basalt ( also known as trap rock ) and sedimentary rock in faulted and tilted layers many hundreds of feet thick . In most cases , the basalt layers are dominant , prevalent , and exposed . The ridge rises dramatically from much lower valley elevations , although only above sea level at its highest , with an average summit elevation of . ",

    "text": "The Great South Australian Coastal Upwelling System is a seasonal upwelling system in the eastern Great Australian Bight , extending from Ceduna , South Australia , to Portland , Victoria , over a distance of about . Upwelling events occur in the austral summer ( from November to May ) when seasonal winds blow from the southeast . These winds blow parallel to the shoreline at certain areas of the coast , which forces coastal waters offshore via Ekman transport and draws up cold , nutrient - rich waters from the ocean floor . Because the deep water carries abundant nutrients up from the ocean floor , the upwelling area differs from the rest of the Great Australian Bight , especially the areas offshore of Western Australia and the Nullabor in South Australia , which are generally nutrient - poor . Every summer , the upwelling sustains a bountiful ecosystem that attracts blue whales and supports rich fisheries . The Great South Australian Coastal Upwelling System ( GSACUS ) is Australia 's only deep - reaching coastal upwelling system , with nutrient - enriched water stemming from depths exceeding . Recently , a new upwelling centre has been discovered on the western shelf of Tasmania . Since this new upwelling centre is located outside South Australian waters , the entire upwelling system should be rather called the Great Southern Australian Coastal Upwelling System . ",

Joining together with Nakano Seig\u014d , Akira Kazami , and others , Adachi formed the right - wing political organization Kokumin D\u014dmei in December 1932 The Kokumin D\u014dmei advocated a form of state socialism or corporatism with government control of strategic industries and financial institutions , and the creation of a Japan - Manchukuo economic union . The new party consisted mainly of defectors from the Minseit\u014d , and had an original strength of 32 seats in the Diet of Japan . In 1934 , it demanded an inquiry into the Teijin Incident in an effort to bring down the cabinet of Prime Minister Sait\u014d Makoto . However , in 1935 , many members returned to the Minseit\u014d fold , and in 1936 , Nakano left the party to form the T\u014dh\u014dkai the following year , and Kazami joining Fumimaro Konoe \u2019s think tank , the Sh\u014dwa Kenky\u016bkai . In the 1937 General Election , the party 's strength fell from 32 seats to 11 seats . In June 1940 , The Kokumin D\u014dmei was merged into the Imperial Rule Assistance Association as part of Hideki T\u014dj\u014d 's efforts to create a one - party state , and thereafter ceased to exist .

It is the final book in Huysmans ' cycle of four novels featuring the character Durtal , a thinly disguised portrait of the author himself . Durtal had already appeared in L\u00e0 - bas , En route and La cath\u00e9drale , which traced his ( and the author 's ) conversion to Catholicism . In L'Oblat , Durtal becomes an oblate , reflecting Huysmans ' own experiences in the religious community at Ligug\u00e9 . Like many of Huysmans ' other novels , it has little plot . The author uses the book to examine the Christian liturgy , express his opinions about the state of Catholicism in contemporary France and explore the question of suffering ( one notable passage describes the Garden of Gethsemane ) .

Lutsenko is also a former leader of the Bloc of Petro Poroshenko party and a former leader of its faction in parliament . On 13 December 2010 Lutsenko was charged with abuse of office and forgery by Prosecutor General of Ukraine Viktor Pshonka . On 27 February 2012 Lutsenko was sentenced to four years in jail for embezzlement and abuse of office . Lutsenko was held at the Lukyanivska Prison from 26 December 2010 until 7 April 2013 when he was released from prison because Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych pardoned him ( among others ) for health reasons . Both Lutsenko and his political allies regard his trial as an act of political persecution by the regime of Viktor Yanukovych . The European Union , the United States Department of State , Canada , human rights organizations , and other international organizations protested against the sentence and questioned whether it was a \" fair , transparent and independent legal process \" . Lutsenko 's wife Iryna Lutsenko is a current member of the Ukrainian parliament . ",

    "text": "Holden New Zealand Limited , named until 1994 as General Motors New Zealand Limited , is a subsidiary of General Motors of Detroit and distributes General Motors ' motor vehicles , engines , components and parts in New Zealand . Its Buick , Chevrolet , Oakland , Oldsmobile and Cadillac brands were all well - established before the first World War . This company was incorporated on 4 January 1926 to build and operate a local assembly plant , General Motors ' first owned not leased overseas plant . Its popular cars , including British Vauxhalls , remained common household brands until well after the second World War . Postwar British sourced Vauxhalls continued to keep the plant running together with limited numbers ( restricted by currency shortages ) of Chevrolets . In the late 1950s the Vauxhall and the now expansive Chevrolet and Pontiac cars began to be replaced with Australian sourced Holden vehicles supplemented by the smallest Vauxhalls and Holdens and the move to the Holden brand was completed in the 1970s . The assembly of vehicles ended in 1990 and since then the business has been distribution of complete imported vehicles and spare parts . ",

    "text": "In English church history , a nonconformist was a Protestant who did not \" conform \" to the governance and usages of the established Church of England . Broad use of the term was precipitated after the Restoration of the British monarchy in 1660 , when the Act of Uniformity 1662 re - established the opponents of reform within the Church of England . By the late 19th century the term specifically included the Reformed Christians ( Presbyterians , Congregationalists and other Calvinist sects ) , plus the Baptists and Methodists . The English Dissenters such as the Puritans who violated the Act of Uniformity 1559\u2014typically by practising radical , sometimes separatist , dissent \u2014 were retrospectively labelled as nonconformists . By law and social custom , nonconformists were restricted from many spheres of public life \u2014 not least , from access to public office , civil service careers , or degrees at university \u2014 and were referred to as suffering from civil disabilities . In England and Wales in the late 19th century the new terms \" free churchman \" and \" Free Church \" started to replace \" dissenter \" or \" Nonconformist \" . One influential nonconformist minister was Matthew Henry , who beginning in 1710 published his multi - volume Commentary that is still used and available in the 21st century . Isaac Watts is an equally recognized nonconformist minister whose hymns are still sung by Christians worldwide . ",

    "text": "The first Battle of Homs was fought on December 10 , 1260 , between the Ilkhanates of Persia and the forces of Egypt , in Syria . After the historic Mamluk victory over the Ilkhanates at the Battle of Ain Jalut in September 1260 , Hulagu Khan of the Ilkhanate had the Ayyubid Sultan of Damascus and other Ayyubid princes executed in revenge , thus effectively ending the dynasty in Syria . However , the defeat at Ain Jalut forced the Ilkhanate armies out of Syria and the Levant . The main cities of Syria , Aleppo and Damascus were thus left open to Mamluk occupation . But Homs and Hama remained in the possession of minor Ayyubid princes . These princes , rather than the Mamluks of Cairo themselves , actually fought and won the First Battle of Homs . Due to the open war between Hulagu and his cousin Berke of the Golden Horde during the civil war of the Mongol Empire , the Ilkhanate could only afford to send 6,000 troops back into Syria to retake control of the lands . This expedition was initiated by Ilkhanate generals such as Baidu who was forced to leave Gaza when the Mamluks advanced just before the battle of Ain Jalut . After quickly recapturing Aleppo , the force travelled southwards to Homs , but were decisively defeated . This ended the first campaign into Syria by the Ilkhanate , though there were several later incursions , none of which ended with conquests lasting more than a year . ",

It was created in 1992 , mostly out of the old Frankston North . The seat is notable for having decided the 1999 state election , which proved to be the last election in which it was contested . The incumbent , Liberal - turned - independent Peter McLellan , died on election day , forcing a supplementary election a month later . Neither the Coalition nor Labor had won a majority , placing the balance of power in the hands of three independents . They deferred their decision until the supplementary election . In the 16 October supplementary election , Labor candidate Matt Viney won on a swing of 7.7 percent , resulting in a hung parliament . The independents then announced their support for Labor , making Labor leader Steve Bracks premier . ",

    "text": "The Admission to the Union Clause of the United States Constitution , oftentimes called the New States Clause , and found at Article IV , Section 3 , , authorizes the Congress to admit new states into the United States beyond the thirteen already in existence at the time the Constitution went into effect . The Constitution went into effect on June 21 , 1788 , after ratification by 9 of the 13 states , and the federal government began operations under it on March 4 , 1789 . Since then , 37 additional states have been admitted into the Union . Each new state has been admitted on an equal footing with those already in existence . Of the 37 states admitted to the Union by Congress , all but six have been established within an existing U.S. organized incorporated territory . A state so created might encompass all or a portion of a territory . When the people of a territory or a region thereof would make their desire for statehood known to the federal government , in most cases Congress passed an enabling act authorizing the people of that territory or region to frame a proposed state constitution as a step toward admission to the Union . Although the use of an enabling act was a common historic practice , a number of states were admitted to the Union without one . In many instances , an enabling act would detail the mechanism by which the territory would be admitted as a state following ratification of their constitution and election of state officers . Although the use of such an act is a traditional historic practice , a number of territories have drafted constitutions for submission to Congress absent an enabling act and were subsequently admitted . The broad outline for this process was established by the Land Ordinance of 1784 and the 1787 Northwest Ordinance , both of which predate the present U.S. Constitution . The Admission to the Union Clause also forbids the creation of new states from parts of existing states without the consent of both the affected states and Congress . The primary intent of this caveat was to give Eastern states that still had western land claims ( there were four at that time ) a veto over whether their western counties could become states . This clause has served the same function since , each time a proposal to partition an existing state or states has arisen . ",

    "text": "The Railroad Revival Tour was an annual music tour that featured popular roots , folk , country , rock , bluegrass and Americana acts that began in 2011 . The musicians travel between shows across the American Southwest in a dozen or so vintage train cars from the 1950s and 1960s . The outdoor concert locations , sometimes attracting over 10,000 fans , are often a stone 's throw from the train . The bands eat , sleep and engage in impromptu jam sessions on the train between stops , giving them a chance to collaborate . On stage at night , they often join in on each other 's sets , sometimes bringing around 30 musicians up to create a rare and rowdy performance . The organic American roots feeling of the tour also prompts participating musicians to honor U.S. railway history , like Mumford & Sons ' tribute to Woody Guthrie in 2011 . The inaugural tour in 2011 included performances by Mumford & Sons , Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros , and Old Crow Medicine Show . A documentary of this first year , called Big Easy Express , directed by Emmett Malloy premiered at SXSW 2012 and won a Grammy Award in 2013 . The film is currently available on iTunes and DVD / Blu - ray Disc . In 2011 , Railroad Revival Tour bands Mumford & Sons , Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros , and Old Crow Medicine Show together closed their shows at every stop with \" This Train . \" The 2012 tour was slated to include performances by Willie Nelson , Band of Horses , Jamey Johnson , and John Reilly and Friends . However , the tour was cancelled for 2012 . ",

The city of Palacios is found on northeastern extension of Tres Palacios Bay , and Port O'Connor is located on the southwestern tip of the main bay 's shore . The ghost town of Indianola , which was a major port before it was destroyed by two hurricanes in the late 19th Century , is also found on the bay . The bay 's shore , especially near the Colorado River delta , provides a habitat for a wide variety of wildlife . The wildlife serves as a basis for the birding and fishing tourism , and is an essential component of the production of seafood , specifically shrimp and blue crab , which are the specialties of the area . The fertile land near the bay is ideal for farming , especially for the propagation of rice . ",

    "text": "Fyns Hoved is a bight of northeastern Funen , Denmark , curving south to form the approach to Odense Fjord . It is the northernmost point of Hindsholm and is thus Funen 's northernmost point , dividing the Kattegat and the Great Belt . The eastern side of the bight between Fyns Hoved and Skoven , to the south , is irregular , with a beach and hills behind it , and to the south of the bight is a small , shallow bay , Korshavn Bay , with the Korshavn Light in the vicinity . The bay is a natural harbour used by many yachtsmen . Fyns Hoved is located in the dry Great Belt region , where rainfall is about per year compared to the national average of per year . This makes it hospitable to plants that are more common in the dry areas of southern Europe . The area is frequented by many shore birds and is also a resting place for migrating birds , and harbour porpoises can be seen offshore . Numerous artists such as Theodor Philipsen , Johannes Larsen and Fritz Syberg have found inspiration in the light and the scenery . There are many stone walls in the area ; these date back to 1810 , when the seven farmers in the village of Nordskov decided to divide the area between them so that they would each have one northern and one southern strip of land . The seven cottagers had to content themselves with sharing one strip . During the German occupation , barracks , a radar installation and artillery on Fyns Hoved guarded the entrance to the Great Belt . ",

    "text": "The Orongorongo River runs for southwest through the Orongorongo Valley in the southern Rimutaka Ranges of the North Island of New Zealand . The river and its associated catchments lie within the bounds of the Rimutaka Forest Park , which is administered by the Department of Conservation . Orongorongo River is the main artery of the Rimutaka Range , draining an area with rainfall of up to a year , which is twice as much as the rainfall at the mouth of the river at Cook Strait . For much of its course the river is a braided river , with a wide bed of greywacke shingle and gravel and a number of streams of water . The gravel bed can be seen as light - coloured areas of varying width in the adjacent image . Because the rainfall in the Rimutaka Range often comes in high - intensity rainstorms , the river is prone to violent floods . The most severe of these floods sweep away most of the river 's vegetated islands every 15 to 20 years . Between these floods , the shingle islands are gradually colonised by various low growing plants , followed by a host of native shrubs such as tauhinu and manuka , and eventually small trees . ",

Skylake is a microarchitecture redesign using the same 14 \u00a0 nm manufacturing process technology as its predecessor , serving as a \" tock \" in Intel 's \" tick - tock \" manufacturing and design model . According to Intel , the redesign brings greater CPU and GPU performance and reduced power consumption . Skylake CPUs share its microarchitecture with Kaby Lake , Coffee Lake and Cannon Lake CPUs . Skylake is the last Intel platform on which Windows earlier than Windows 10 will be officially supported by Microsoft , although enthusiast - created modifications exist that allow Windows 8.1 and earlier to continue to receive updates on later platforms . Some of the processors based on the Skylake microarchitecture are marketed as \" 6th - generation Core \" . On October 8 , 2018 , Intel announced new 9th gen Core X 98xx/99xx series CPUs , with the Core i9 - 9980XE Extreme Edition leading the launch . ",

It took part in the 29 July 2001 presidential elections , in which its candidate , Fradique de Menezes , won 55.2 % of the vote and was elected president . After the elections Fradique de Menezes joined a new party - the Force for Change Democratic Movement - Liberal Party .

It is one of the common names in the Middle East and among Muslim nations . Of all of Jacob 's children , Joseph was the one given the gift of prophecy . Although the narratives of other prophets are mentioned in various Surahs , the complete narrative of Joseph is given only in one Surah , Yusuf , making it unique . It is said to be the most detailed narrative in the Qur'an and bears more details than the Biblical counterpart . Yusuf is believed to have been the eleventh son of Ya\u02bfq\u016bb ( , Jacob ) , and , according to many scholars , his favorite . According to Ibn Kathir , \" Jacob had twelve sons who were the eponymous ancestors of the tribes of the Israelites . The noblest , the most exalted , the greatest of them was Joseph . \" The story begins with Joseph revealing a ru'ya ( , ' dream ' or ' vision ' ) to his father , which Jacob recognizes . In addition to the role of God in his life , the story of Yusuf and Zulaikha ( Potiphar 's wife of the Old Testament ) became a popular subject in Persian literature , where it became considerably elaborated over the centuries . More recently , and relying on the Quran and Muslim , Christian and Jewish scholarly sources , Yusuf 's story has been depicted in a 45-part TV series ( originally in Persian but also dubbed in multiple other languages ) .

    "text": "American Theocracy : The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion , Oil , and Borrowed Money in the 21st Century ( ) is a 2005 political commentary book by American political writer Kevin Phillips . The book is a critique of the past forty years of the Republican coalition in United States politics . He \" presents a nightmarish vision of ideological extremism , catastrophic fiscal irresponsibility , rampant greed , and dangerous shortsightedness . \" Phillips points to three unifying themes holding this coalition together . First , its tie to oil and the role oil plays in American and world events . Second , to the coalition of social conservatives , Evangelicals and Pentecostals in this Republican coalition . Finally , he points to the \" debt culture \" of this coalition , and to a coming \" debt bubble \" related to the debt of the U.S. Government and U.S. consumers . He argues that similar issues have been prevalent in the past , when other world powers , such as the Roman Empire and the British Empire declined from their peaks and fell into disarray . While working as a strategist in the presidential campaign of Richard Nixon , Phillips wrote The Emerging Republican Majority . In that book , Phillips predicted the formation of this very coalition that he criticizes in his current book . In American Theocracy he admits that while these \" mutations , \" as he calls them , could have been predicted , he did not foresee the extent to which they would develop and dominate the coalition he helped put together . The last chapter of this book references his first work , and is called \" The Erring Republican Majority . \" ",

He was Earl of Ross and the 4th Lord of the Isles as well as being Mac Domhnaill , chief of Clan Donald . John would however prove to be the last of the Lords of the Isles , overmighty subjects of the Stewart Kings of Scotland and virtual kings in their own right in the Western Isles . His struggle for power with King James III of Scotland ended in humiliation , following which his illegitimate son Angus \u00d3g rebelled against his rule . In a bitter civil war , John 's fleet of galleys met those of Angus sometime in the early 1480s off the coast of Mull at the Battle of Bloody Bay , in which John 's cause was defeated . After Bloody Bay he became an inconsequential figure ; and Angus continued to dominate the affairs of Clan Donald up until his murder in 1490 . In 1493 James IV brought the Lordship of the Isles to an end . John died unlamented in 1503 , having witnessed the almost complete destruction of his family inheritance . ",

    "text": "Cornelius Ryan 's A Bridge Too Far gives an account of Operation Market Garden , a failed Allied attempt to break through German lines at Arnhem in the occupied Netherlands during World War II . The title of the book comes from a comment made by British Lieutenant General Frederick Browning , deputy commander of the First Allied Airborne Army , who told Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery before the operation , \" I think we may be going a bridge too far . \" Drawing on a wide variety of sources , Ryan also documented his account of the 1944 battle with pictures and maps and included a section on the survivors , \u201c Soldiers and Civilians \u2013 What They Do Today \u201d . One particular focus was on the tactical mistakes made in planning the operation . Until Ryan 's book , Market Garden had been a classic example of victors writing the history . Popular accounts of World War II usually tended not to mention the battle at all or put Montgomery 's spin on it as being a \" partial success \" . The 1974 book was published by Simon & Schuster in New York and by Hamish Hamilton in London . There were frequent later editions , and a film based on it was released in 1977 . ",

Gabriel has said that the song is about a relationship in which the woman is sophisticated , bright , cultured , and knows everything about anything and that the man knows nothing about anything , except , he does know about the woman , and she does n't know much about herself . In certain countries , \" Steam \" was more successful than Gabriel 's previous single , \" Digging in the Dirt \" , but in others , it was not . It reached number 10 on the UK Singles Chart , number 32 on the US Billboard Hot 100 , and number one on the US Modern Rock Tracks chart . Elsewhere , the song was a number - one hit in Canada , topping the RPM Top Singles chart for the issue dated February 27 , 1993 , knocking Whitney Houston 's massive hit \" I Will Always Love You \" off the top spot after a 10-week run . It was also a top 10 hit in New Zealand and Ireland , peaking at number seven in both countries . An alternative version of this song called \" Quiet Steam \" was a B - side on the \" Digging in the Dirt \" single . It is a very lo - fi take on the popular version that appeared on the album . On Secret World Live , \" Steam \" is preceded for a minute or so by the \" Quiet Steam \" version . ",

    "text": "The Orange brand in India , through a complicated set of mergers and divisions , was acquired and eventually retained by Orange S.A. ; and currently operates as Orange Business Services India ( OBS India ) . On 14 February 2000 , Hutchison Max \u2013 an Indian telecom joint venture majority owned by Hong Kong based Hutchison Whampoa introduced the brand in the country , through the rebranding of its existing Mumbai telecom circle Cell phone service \u2013 ' Max Touch ' , to ' Orange ' . Shortly , issues arose concerning the ownership of the ' Orange ' brand in India , when France Telecom in May 2000 purchased the worldwide rights for the brand . Hutchison Essar ( earlier Hutchinson Max ) ended using the brand in Jan 2006 . Orange returned to the country in July 2007 , as Orange Business Services India , when France Telecom acquired the enterprise network services and managed services business of GTL Ltd. Since then , OBS India has grown to become one of the country 's major data connectivity solutions provider . Currently , it has a network with 14 points of presence ( PoP ) in the country and has offices in eight locations with over 1500 employees , offering business services to local as well as global enterprises in cloud computing , unified communications and collaboration .

    "text": "John Henry Dearle or J. H. Dearle ( 1859 in London \u2013 15 January 1932 ) was a British textile and stained - glass designer trained by the artist and craftsman William Morris who was much influenced by the Pre - Raphaelite Brotherhood . Dearle designed many of the later wallpapers and textiles released by Morris & Co. , and contributed background and foliage patterns to tapestry designs featuring figures by Edward Burne - Jones and others . Beginning in his teens as a shop assistant and then design apprentice , Dearle rose to become Morris & Co. 's chief designer by 1890 , creating designs for tapestries , embroidery , wallpapers , woven and printed textiles , stained glass , and carpets . Following Morris 's death in 1896 , Dearle was appointed Art Director of the firm , and became its principal stained glass designer on the death of Burne - Jones in 1898 . Morris 's reputation overshadowed Dearle 's work throughout Dearle 's career : Dearle exhibited early patterns under Morris 's name and Dearle designs continue to be sold as Morris patterns . Critical assessment of Dearle 's work then underwent a significant change , during the final decades of the twentieth century , recognizing Dearle 's mature work as having a unique artistic vision of its own . Dearle always remained close to Morris 's esthetic , but from the 1890s onward he incorporated a distinctive set of Persian and Turkish influences . ",

    "text": "Raetia was the name of a canton of the Helvetic Republic from 1798 to 1803 , corresponding to modern Graub\u00fcnden and composed of the Free State of the Three Leagues . Until 1799 , the canton was administered by the central government of the Helvetic Republic . The districts of Chiavenna , Valtellina and Bormio , previously dependencies of the Leagues , were never a part of the canton , having permanently been detached from the Leagues after Revolutionary France fomented revolt there , leading them to be annexed to the Cisalpine Republic on October 10 , 1797 . The districts subsequently joined the Austrian client kingdom of Lombardy - Venetia after the Congress of Vienna and eventually become the Italian province of Sondrio . The town of Campione , an imperial fief into the Landvogtei of Lugano at the same time , joined Lombardy leading to its current position as an Italian enclave within Ticino . With the Napoleonic Act of Mediation in 1803 , the canton was reestablished as Graub\u00fcnden , finally incorporating the Three Leagues into a decentralized and federal Switzerland . ",

Owned by the museum of the Detroit Institute of Arts in Detroit , Michigan , the work was discovered by its director in England in 1930 , and brought to Detroit . It is believed to be one of a set of three Bruegel works from around the same time , The Wedding Dance , The Peasant Wedding ( 1567 ) and The Peasant Dance ( 1569 ) . The painting depicts 125 wedding guests . As was customary in the Renaissance period , the brides wore black and men wore codpieces . Voyeurism is depicted throughout the entire art work ; dancing was disapproved of by the authorities and the church , and the painting can be seen as both a critique and comic depiction of a stereotypical oversexed , overindulgent , peasant class of the times .

It was written at the request of Pope Paul VI to counter the emergence of perceived rampant liberalism after the Second Vatican Council ( 1962 - 1965 ) . The Catholic Catechism was a significant work in the sense that it essentially brought modern Vatican II Catholic teaching and faith into one book , unlike any other before , and was a precursor to the Catechism of the Catholic Church , which is the official codified teaching of the Catholic Church , written by Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger ( now Pope Benedict XVI ) and promulgated by Pope John Paul II in 1992 . Hardon 's Catholic Catechism remains a standard work on Catholic orthodoxy even to this day . The book is published with the nihil obstat and imprimatur . ",

    "text": "\" Long Hard Road Out of Hell \" is a song by American rock band Marilyn Manson and British trip hop band Sneaker Pimps , released as a single from the soundtrack to the 1997 motion picture Spawn . An arena rock and gothic rock song , \" Long Hard Road Out of Hell \" was written by Marilyn Manson and Twiggy Ramirez and produced by Manson and Sean Beavan . Its lyrics are about self - loathing and its title is derived from John Milton 's Paradise Lost ( 1667 ) . After the track was written , the Sneaker Pimps ' Kelli Ali was recruited to perform background vocals on it , as the Spawn soundtrack featured collaborations between hard rock artists and electronic music artists . The Sneaker Pimps were dissatisfied with the final track and wanted a remix of it to be released as a single instead ; conversely , Manson deemed it a personal favorite . \" Long Hard Road Out of Hell \" received mixed reviews from music critics ; some found it heartfelt while others felt it was too indistinct from other Marilyn Manson songs . Commentators noted that the track encapsulated the evolution of the band 's sound from the industrial music of Antichrist Superstar ( 1996 ) to the glam rock of Mechanical Animals ( 1998 ) . Manson initially approached Jonathan Glazer to direct the video for the track , but rejected his concept for it ; Glazer later used his concept for the video for Radiohead 's \" Karma Police \" ( 1997 ) . The music video for \" Long Hard Road Out of Hell \" was directed by Matthew Rolston . It depicts Manson in a dress and a group of models who initially appear to be female but are revealed to be male . The clip garnerd acclaim from critics for its imagery . ",

Created by directors Ron Clements and John Musker and animated by Mark Henn , Tiana is voiced by Anika Noni Rose as an adult , while Elizabeth M. Dampier voices the character as a child . Tiana is loosely based on two princesses : Princess Emma , the heroine of E. D. Baker 's novel The Frog Princess , and the princess from the Brothers Grimm fairy tale \" The Frog Prince \" , which inspired Baker 's novel . A hardworking waitress who dreams of opening her own restaurant , Tiana finds her progress stalled when she transforms into a frog after desperately kissing a prince who has been turned into one by an evil witch doctor . The ninth Disney Princess , Tiana is the first to be of African - American heritage . Tiana has been mostly positively received , with critics praising her personality and values . However , the depiction of Tiana and her community has been criticized for lacking \" emphasis on racial issues \" . The decision to depict the two main characters , Tiana and Naveen , as frogs for the majority of the movie has also caused controversy , with some saying that it is equating people of color to animals .

This rural area south of Wuhan ) , situated in the south bank of the middle reaches of Yangtze River . The lake is 370 \u00a0 km , with a drainage area of 3265 \u00a0 km , an elevation of 20 m , length 31.7 \u00a0 km and mean width 9.6 \u00a0 km ( max 12.3 m ) . The shoreline of lake is highly indented . Liangzi Lake appears to have two outlets . On the northers side of the lake , a small river or canal flows from Liangzi into Tangxun Lake ( ) , and urban lake on the south side of Wuhan , which eventually drains into the Yangtze . On the eastern side of the lake , another river flows from Liangzi Lake toward Ezhou , where it enters the Yangtze as well .

The lake is rich in fish and it is the origin of Wuchang Bream . Analysis of core samples extracted from the bottom of the lake allows scientists to measure the presence of metals such as copper , lead , nickel and zinc in the environment over the last several thousand ages ; they provide evidence for the existence of mining and metal smelting in the region as early as 1500 BC , during the time of the State of Chu . ( The Huangshi / Daye region east of the lake continues to be a mining and metallurgical center to this day . ) \" Sister Lakes \" partnership has been established between Liangzi Lake and Lake Pepin in Minnesota .

On the American Civil War battlefield , different instruments including bugles , drums , and fifes were played to issue marching orders or sometimes simply to boost the morale of one 's fellow soldiers . Singing was also employed as a recreational activity but as a release from the inevitable tensions that come with fighting in a war , particularly a war in which the issue of freedom of a race is to be decided . In camp , music was a diversion away from the bloodshed , helping the soldiers deal with homesickness and boredom . Soldiers of both sides often engaged in recreation with musical instruments , and when the opposing armies were near each other , sometimes the bands from both sides of the conflict played against each other on the night before a battle . Each side had its particular favorite tunes , while some music was enjoyed by Northerners and Southerners alike , as exemplified by United States President Abraham Lincoln 's love of Dixie , the unofficial anthem of the Confederacy . To this day , many of the songs are sung when a patriotic piece is required . The war 's music also inspired music artists such as Lynyrd Skynyrd and Elvis Presley . ",

    "text": "Carol II ( 15 October 18934 April 1953 ) reigned as King of Romania from 8 June 1930 until his coerced abdication on 6 September 1940 . Carol was the eldest son of Ferdinand I and became crown prince upon the death of his grand - uncle , King Carol I in 1914 . He was the first of the Hohenzollern kings of Romania to be born in the country ( both of his predecessors were born and grew up in Germany and only came to Romania as adults ) . Carol , by contrast , spoke Romanian as his first language and was the first member of the Romanian royal family to be raised in the Orthodox faith . He possessed a hedonistic personality that contributed to the controversies marring his reign , and his life was marked by numerous scandals , among them marriages to Zizi Lambrino and Princess Helen of Greece and Denmark , daughter of King Constantine I of Greece . His continued affairs with Magda Lupescu obliged him to renounce his succession rights in 1925 and leave the country . Princess Helen eventually divorced him in 1928 . King Ferdinand died in 1927 and Carol 's five - year - old son ascended the throne as Michael I. Carol then returned to Romania in 1930 and replaced his son and the regency that had been in place . His reign was marked by re - alignment with Nazi Germany , adoption of anti - semitic laws and ultimately evolved into a personal dictatorship beginning in 1938 . On 6 September 1940 , he was forced by his Prime Minister Ion Antonescu to leave the country and withdraw abroad into exile . He was succeeded by his son Michael . ",

Fastow was one of the key figures behind the complex web of off - balance - sheet special purpose entities ( limited partnerships which Enron controlled ) used to conceal Enron 's massive losses in their quarterly balance sheets . By unlawfully maintaining personal stakes in these ostensibly independent ghost - entities , he was able to defraud Enron out of tens of millions of dollars . The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission subsequently opened an investigation into his and the company 's conduct in 2001 . Fastow served a six - year prison sentence for charges related to these acts . His wife , Lea Weingarten , also worked at Enron , where she was an assistant treasurer ; she pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud , money laundering conspiracy and filing fraudulent income tax returns , and served jail time before early release to a halfway house .

    "text": "Andrea Lilio ( 1555 - 1642 ) was an Italian painter born in Ancona , hence he also is known as L'Anconitano . He painted mainly in his native city , as well as in Rome , where he was active from the beginning of the 17th century until around 1640 . He was employed by Pope Sixtus V in the decoration of the library of the Vatican and in the decoration of the Scala Santa in San Giovanni Laterano . In the latter , he painted , Moses striking the Rock and Moses with the Brazen Serpent . Said to have been a pupil of Federico Barocci , Lilio created a popular niche for himself by painting allegories for aristocratic audiences . In fact , it is altogether possible that Lilio collaborated for the illustrations of Cesare Ripa 's Iconologia , which was a popular source for such motifs for a very long time . He died at Ascoli Piceno . In a chapel of the Chiesa Nuova , he painted The Archangel Michael driving fallen angels from Heaven . He continued to ornament churches and convents of Rome during the reign of Pope Clement VIII . One of his masterpieces , the Martyrdom of Saint Lawrence , was painted for Santa Caterina in Ancona . He painted the Christ Washing the Feet of His Disciples for the nave of Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome . He also was part of the team active in the painting of the Sistine chapel ( chapel of Nativity ) in Santa Maria Maggiore . For the cathedral of Fano , he painted a picture of All Saints . Four new allegorical paintings by Lilio were identified in Milan 's Bagatti Valsecchi Museum , Milan . ",

    "text": "Stars and Stripes Forever is a 1952 American Technicolor film biography of the late-19th-/early-20th - century composer and band leader John Philip Sousa . This 20th Century Fox feature was produced by Lamar Trotti , directed by Henry Koster , and stars Clifton Webb , Debra Paget , Robert Wagner , and Ruth Hussey . The film 's title is taken from Sousa 's \" The Stars and Stripes Forever \" , which has become the best known of his military marches . While the film 's storyline is loosely based on Sousa 's autobiography Marching Along , the film takes considerable liberties and dramatic license , often expanding and examining themes and passages from Sousa 's book . Two examples : In the film , Private Willie Little ( Robert Wagner ) , is credited with inventing the Sousaphone and naming it after his mentor , but in reality Sousa himself designed the instrument . The inspiration for the film 's title march is depicted in a scene with a voice over by Webb quoting Sousa 's actual description of its creation while he was aboard ship recovering from typhoid fever . In reality , having learned of the sudden death of his band 's manager , Sousa and his wife canceled their European vacation and were returning to the U.S. by steamship when the march came to him .

The lead track on the single is \" My Red Hot Car ( Girl ) \" , which leaves the pop music aspects of the song intact . An extended version of \" My Red Hot Car \" is featured on the album Go Plastic . My Red Hot Car is notable for two different hidden tracks , based on format : the CD version features an ambient piece after 23 minutes of silence , while the vinyl features a percussion - less version of \" I Wish You Obelisk \" presented behind a silent , locked groove , meaning the needle must be lifted halfway through the second side and placed after the locked groove in order to hear it . The single was selected as NME Single of the Week in its week of release . ",

He was the pupil of artist Howard Pyle and became one of America 's greatest illustrators . During his lifetime , Wyeth created over 3,000 paintings and illustrated 112 books , 25 of them for Scribner 's , the Scribner Classics , which is the work for which he is best known . The first of these , Treasure Island , was one of his masterpieces and the proceeds paid for his studio . Wyeth was a realist painter just as the camera and photography began to compete with his craft . Sometimes seen as melodramatic , his illustrations were designed to be understood quickly . Wyeth , who was both a painter and an illustrator , understood the difference , and said in 1908 , \" Painting and illustration can not be mixed \u2014 one can not merge from one into the other . \" He is the father of Andrew Wyeth and the grandfather of Jamie Wyeth , both known American painters .

    "text": "Historiographic metafiction is a term coined by Canadian literary theorist Linda Hutcheon in the late 1980s . The term is used for works of fiction which combine the literary devices of metafiction with historical fiction . Works regarded as historiographic metafiction are also distinguished by frequent allusions to other artistic , historical and literary texts ( i.e. intertextuality ) in order to show the extent to which works of both literature and historiography are dependent on the history of discourse . The term is closely associated with works of postmodern literature , usually novels . According to Hutcheon , in \" A Poetics of Postmodernism \" , works of historiographic metafiction are \" those well - known and popular novels which are both intensely self - reflexive and yet paradoxically also lay claim to historical events and personages \" . Works often described as examples of historiographical metafiction include : William Shakespeare 's Pericles , Prince of Tyre ( c.1608 ) , John Fowles ' The French Lieutenant 's Woman ( 1969 ) , E. L. Doctorow 's Ragtime ( 1975 ) , William Kennedy 's Legs ( 1975 ) , Salman Rushdie 's Midnight 's Children ( 1981 ) , A. S. Byatt 's Possession ( 1990 ) , Michael Ondaatje 's The English Patient ( 1992 ) , Thomas Pynchon 's Mason & Dixon ( 1997 ) and many others . By seeking to represent both actual historical events from World War Two while , at the same time , problematizing the very notion of doing exactly that , Kurt Vonnegut 's Slaughterhouse - Five ( 1969 ) features a metafictional , \" Janus - headed \" perspective .

This is focused on an EMH ( The Doctor)-like hologram on another ship , which is dealt with mostly by the Doctor and B'Elanna . In addition , sub - plots run their course on Voyager with other characters . Guest star Leland Orser plays the EMH - like hologram Dejaren on a spaceship that is encountered by Voyager . Leland Orser had also played a character on Deep Space Nine . The episode , in retrospect , was noted for a possible allusion to male sexual abuse via the hologram . In contrast to historical examples in Trek history , like Bajoran comfort women , the character of Dejaren has been compared to Gigolo Joe from Spielberg 's 2001 film A.I .. However , this may be too broad an interpretation of the episode noting a more basic horror film element . The episode is noted as playing homage to the tradition of \" trashy science fiction horror \" vibe in the Star Trek universe as portrayed by episodes like \" \" , \" \" , \" \" , \" \" , \" \" , \" \" , \" \" , \" \" , \" \" , \" \" , \" \" , \" \" , \" \" , \" \" , \" Dark Page \" , \" \" , \" \" , \" \" or \" \" .

    "text": "\" The Murders in the Rue Morgue \" is a short story by Edgar Allan Poe published in Graham 's Magazine in 1841 . It has been recognized as the first modern detective story ; Poe referred to it as one of his \" tales of ratiocination \" . C. Auguste Dupin is a man in Paris who solves the mystery of the brutal murder of two women . Numerous witnesses heard a suspect , though no one agrees on what language was spoken . At the murder scene , Dupin finds a hair that does not appear to be human . As the first fictional detective , Poe 's Dupin displays many traits which became literary conventions in subsequent fictional detectives , including Sherlock Holmes and Hercule Poirot . Many later characters , for example , follow Poe 's model of the brilliant detective , his personal friend who serves as narrator , and the final revelation being presented before the reasoning that leads up to it . Dupin himself reappears in \" The Mystery of Marie Rog\u00eat \" and \" The Purloined Letter \" . ",

    "text": "Song of Freedom is a 1936 British film directed by J. Elder Wills and starring Paul Robeson . One of two elements pivotal to the plot is an opera composer named Gabriel Donizetti , presumably suggested by the historical opera composer Gaetano Donizetti . The other is a medallion that serves to identify Robeson 's character as a descendant of an African monarch . Song of Freedom may best represent the opportunity Robeson was looking for to \" give a true picture of many aspects of the life of the coloured man in the West . Hitherto on the screen , he has been characterized or presented only as a comedy character . This film shows him as a real man . \" Robeson was also given final cut approval on the film , an unprecedented option at the time for an actor of any race . As in Sanders of the River , the film called for documentary scenes of West African traditional dances and ceremonies , but this time Robeson obtained a contract giving him final cut , so that the film \u2019s message would not be changed behind the doors of the editing room . Robeson plays Zinga , a black dockworker in England with a great baritone singing voice . He is discovered by an opera impresario , and is catapulted into great fame as an international opera star . Yet he feels alienated from his African past , and out of place in England . By chance , he is informed that an ancestral medallion that he wears is proof of his lineage to African kings , and he leaves fame and fortune to take his rightful place of royalty . Reunited with his people , he plans to improve their lives by combining the best of western technology with the best of traditional African ways . Although the film was not a box office success in the US , it was notably chosen in 1950 to open the convention of Ghana 's Convention People 's Party . The ceremonies were presided over by the future first prime minister of independent Ghana , Kwame Nkrumah , Robeson 's friend from his London years . ",

Trump has proposed sizable income tax cuts and deregulation consistent with conservative ( Republican Party ) policies , along with significant infrastructure investment and protection for entitlements for the elderly , typically considered liberal ( Democratic Party ) policies . His anti - globalization policies of trade protectionism and immigration reduction cross party lines . Trump has said that he is \" totally flexible on very , very many issues . \" Trump 's signature issue is immigration , especially illegal immigration , and in particular building or expanding a border wall between the U.S. and Mexico . As of October 2016 , Trump 's campaign had posted fourteen categories of policy proposals on his website , which have been since removed . During October 2016 , Trump outlined a series of steps for his first 100 days in office . Trump 's political positions , and his descriptions of his beliefs , have frequently changed . Politico has described his positions as \" eclectic , improvisational and often contradictory . \" According to an NBC News count , over the course of his campaign Trump made \" 141 distinct shifts on 23 major issues . \" Fact - checking organizations reported that during the campaign , Trump made a record number of false statements and lies compared to other candidates , a pattern that continued once in office .

    "text": "The is a subregion of the Ch\u016bbu region and Kansai region in Japan that runs along the Pacific Ocean . The name comes from the T\u014dkaid\u014d , one of the Edo Five Routes . Because T\u014dkai is a sub - region and is not officially classified , there is some disagreement about where exactly the region begins and ends , however Japanese maps widely conclude that the region includes Shizuoka , Aichi , Gifu and Mie prefectures . The largest major city in the region is Nagoya and the Ch\u016bky\u014d Metropolitan Area ( Nagoya Metropolitan Area ) makes up a large portion of the region and has Japan 's third strongest economy . The business influence of this urban area sometimes extends out into the outlying areas of the three prefectures centered on Nagoya which are Aichi , Gifu , and Mie ; this area is sometimes referred to as the Ch\u016bky\u014d region . T\u014dkai is a heavy manufacturing area and is one of the most industrial regions in Japan . Its coast is lined with densely populated cities with economies that thrive on factories . The T\u014dkai region has experienced a number of large earthquakes in the past , including the two great earthquakes in 1944 ( also known as the \" Tonankai earthquake \" ) and 1945 ( also known as the \" Mikawa earthquake \" ) . Following the work of Kiyoo Mogi , it is predicted that there is a possibility that the area will be subject to a shallow magnitude 8.0 earthquake in the near future . Nagoya , Shizuoka , and other large cities would be greatly damaged , with potential casualties in the tens of thousands . The Coordinating Committee for Earthquake Prediction designated the region as an Area of Specific Observation in 1970 , and upgraded it to an Area of Intensified Observation in 1974 . ",

    "text": "Lough Owel ( ) is a mesotrophic lough in the Midlands of Ireland , situated north of Mullingar , the county town of Westmeath . It has a maximum depth of 22 m . Water from Lough Owel feeds the Royal Canal , a canal crossing Ireland from Dublin to the River Shannon . Access to the lake can be gained from a carpark and pier to the south of the N4 Mullingar to Longford route . Lough Owel and Lough Ennell are two of many lakes that form the River Brosna drainage basin . The Brosna is a tributary of the Shannon , flowing through Mullingar and Kilbeggan , both in Westmeath , and from there through the town of Clara ( County Offaly ) into the Shannon . The Viking chieftain Turgesius was drowned in Lough Owel by M\u00e1el Sechnaill mac Ma\u00edl Ruanaid in 845 . Since 1996 the lough has received international protection as a Ramsar site . It is noted for its birdlife and is also well known amongst anglers , and holds a few char along with brown trout . ",

    "text": "The Battle of Sio , fought between December 1943 and March 1944 , was the break - out and pursuit phase of General Douglas MacArthur 's Huon Peninsula campaign , part of the New Guinea campaign of World War II . After the defeat of the Japanese in the Battle of Sattelberg , Australian Army forces broke through the Japanese positions around Finschhafen . Constant pressure from US Navy PT boats , Australian land forces and Allied aircraft brought the Japanese logistical system to the brink of collapse , resulting in disease , malnutrition , and privation for the Japanese soldiers . Meanwhile , the Allied supply system grappled with the problems of terrain and climate , particularly inclement weather and rough monsoonal seas that hampered and occasionally prevented delivery of supplies by sea . Australian and Papuan troops advanced along the coast of the Huon Peninsula , using infantry , tanks , and air strikes against the Japanese positions , which were generally sited at creek crossings in the jungle . The advancing infantry kept strictly within range of the supporting artillery , which was liberally employed in the early stages of the operation . Using tactics that exploited the firepower of Australian artillery and armour , the Australian and Papuan troops inflicted heavy and disproportionate casualties on the Japanese as they advanced , ultimately linking up with the American forces at Saidor . Hundreds of Japanese soldiers were killed ; thousands more died from disease , malnutrition , exhaustion and suicide . The Allies failed to seize the opportunity to completely destroy the Japanese forces . During the advance , Australian troops captured Japanese cryptographic materials . This had an important effect on the subsequent course of the war against Japan in the South West Pacific , as it permitted codebreakers in Australia and the United States to read Japanese Army messages on a much greater scale than previously .

It is based on another old ballad , \" James A. Rogers \" . The song is told from the point of view of the assassin himself . For a while , it was believed that Guiteau wrote the song himself , possibly because of the poem \" I am Going to the Lordy \" , which Guiteau actually did write on the day of his execution . It is not to be confused with another ballad about the assassination , \" Mr. Garfield , \" which was popularized by Johnny Cash . Bascom Lamar Lunsford recorded both songs in 1949 for the Library of Congress . ",

    "text": "The six Cello Suites , BWV 1007 - 1012 , are suites for unaccompanied cello by Johann Sebastian Bach . They are some of the most frequently performed and recognizable solo compositions ever written for cello . Bach most likely composed them during the period 1717 \u2013 23 , when he served as Kapellmeister in K\u00f6then . The title given on the cover of the Anna Magdalena Bach manuscript was Suites \u00e0 Violoncello Solo senza Basso ( Suites for cello solo without bass ) . These suites for unaccompanied cello are remarkable in that they achieve the effect of implied three- to four - voice contrapuntal and polyphonic music in a single musical line . As usual in a Baroque musical suite , after the prelude which begins each suite , all the other movements are based around baroque dance types ; the cello suites are structured in six movements each : prelude , allemande , courante , sarabande , two minuets or two bourr\u00e9es or two gavottes , and a final gigue . The Bach cello suites are considered to be among the most profound of all classical music works . Wilfrid Mellers described them in 1980 as \" Monophonic music wherein a man has created a dance of God . \" Due to the works ' technical demands , \u00e9tude - like nature , and difficulty in interpretation because of the non - annotated nature of the surviving copies , the cello suites were little known and rarely publicly performed until they were revived and recorded by Pablo Casals in the early 20th century . They have since been performed and recorded by many renowned cellists and have been transcribed for numerous other instruments ; they are considered some of Bach 's greatest musical achievements . ",

The Historic Columbia River Highway passes nearby , and at certain locations the Lower falls are visible from the road . Near the base of the falls , a parking lot and path were erected to assist visitors to the site . Visitors must hike along the loop trail to see the upper falls . Latourell is unique among the best - known Columbia Gorge waterfalls , in the way that it drops straight down from an overhanging basalt cliff . Most of those falls ( even the famous Multnomah Falls ) tumble to some degree . Latourell Falls is an excellent example of columnar basalt formations . ",

    "text": "Michael John \" Mike \" Padden ( born November 13 , 1946 ) is a lawyer and politician from Spokane Valley , Washington . He is a member of the Washington State Senate representing Washington 's 4th Legislative District . Padden is well known as a \" faithless elector \" , a Presidential Elector who casts his vote for someone other than for whom he has pledged to vote . In the 1976 U.S. presidential election , Gerald Ford , the Republican candidate and incumbent , had lost the race to Democrat , and former Georgia Governor Jimmy Carter . Rather than vote as pledged , for President Ford , Padden instead cast his vote for Ronald Reagan , who had lost the Republican nomination to Ford earlier that year . He entered the Washington House of Representatives in January 1981 and served there until 1995 when he was appointed to serve as a district court judge in the Spokane County District Court . On June 13 , 2006 , Padden announced he would not run for re - election as judge . In 2007 , evidence surfaced that Padden used his influence as a judge to help direct more than $ 7.5 million in fees and interest payments to a former employer . At Padden \u2019s request , the state Commission on Judicial Conduct has issued a statement confirming that it examined complaints about Padden \u2019s 1999 selection of a former client as the official collection agency for District Court but found nothing to support an ethics violation . The commission typically acknowledges complaints only if it imposes discipline or sanctions . The agency , however , refused to disclose how it arrived at its conclusion or what the initial examination entailed . Padden was elected to the Washington Senate in November 2011 . ",

Esch had a farming business and did a Ph.D. in business administration at Uppsala University in 1972 . Before joining the Christian Democrats , he had previously represented Moderate Party in the Riksdag 1991 \u2013 1994 , replacing Per Westerberg during his time as a minister . At the time of the Swedish 1994 referendum on membership in the European Union , Esch clashed with the Moderate Party as he campaigned on the \" no \" side . When he subsequently formed a list of EU critics that ran in the 1995 European Parliament election in Sweden , he was expelled from the party . This list was unsuccessful in the election , and von der Esch returned to parliamentary politics in 1998 as a Christian Democrat . In the 2003 referendum on joining the Economic and Monetary Union and the euro , he again campaigned on the \" no \" side . He later joined the June List , became its vice chairman in 2008 , and was on second place on the June List ballot in the 2009 European Parliament election in which the party lost its representation in the European Parliament .

A \" playoff \" game was played in 1932 between the Chicago Bears and Portsmouth Spartans to break a regular season tie , but is recorded in the team record books as a regular season game . Since then there have been a total over 525 NFL playoff games including games from the AFL , but not the AAFC . The following list shows career postseason records for each starting quarterback in the NFL playoffs . Wins or losses are credited to the quarterback who started the game for each team , even if he was injured or failed to complete the game . While many players have won playoff games for two teams , only two have won a championship for different franchises . Tobin Rote was quarterback for the NFL champion 1957 Lions and the AFL champion 1963 Chargers . Peyton Manning was the quarterback for 2006 Colts and the 2015 Broncos . Note : from 1933\u20131949 some offenses did not employ a quarterback in the modern sense of the position . Listed below are the \" primary passers \" for those games , the players that passed the ball most in those games . They may not have actually started the game at quarterback . This format allows Hall of Fame quarterbacks like Sid Luckman and Sammy Baugh to maintain credit for their team 's playoff records since they were obviously the top passer for their team . The players involved in such games are marked with an asterisk ( * ) . ",

Complex irrigation systems were built in the 9th century . The French colonial period left the large feudal landholdings intact . Roads and a railway were built , and rubber , rice and corn grown . After independence Sihanouk pursued a policy of economic independence , securing aid and investment from a number of countries . Bombing and other effects of the war during the Vietnam War damaged rice production . Lon Nol had a policy of liberalising the economy . This was followed by the victory of the Khmer Rouge and the emptying of the cities . After the defeat of the Khmer Rouge , a Five Year Plan was adopted , aiming to improve agriculture , industry and distribution , with a slogan of \" export and thrift \" .

    "text": "The Orange Grove affair was a political scandal in Australia concerning the dealings of the New South Wales state Australian Labor Party government with multinational corporation The Westfield Group . It resulted from a court decision in 2004 to force the closure of the Orange Grove shopping centre after a zoning dispute , with the loss of approximately 200 jobs . Westfield , who owned a nearby shopping centre , had challenged the legitimacy of the Orange Grove centre , which was operating on land not zoned for this purpose . When the courts ruled in Westfield 's favor , Liverpool City Council sought State Government approval for a retrospective rezoning , to validate its earlier decision to approve the shopping centre . The State Government declined to intervene , despite a planning report suggesting that course of action , and the retail component of the Orange Grove centre was forced to close . The bulky goods component of the centre remained open , as the centre was legally zoned for bulky goods sales . However , the state Opposition subsequently unearthed information about a meeting between Premier Bob Carr 's chief of staff and a prominent Westfield employee , sparking allegations that interference from Westfield had played a role in the government 's decision not to intervene . As a result , a parliamentary inquiry was commissioned , and the Independent Commission Against Corruption announced an investigation . The investigation concluded in 2005 , with no findings of corruption against any person . However , the Commission recommended that the NSW Government strengthen guidelines for public servants dealing with corruption allegations by lobbyists . Unlike Nick Greiner in 1992 and Barry O'Farrell in 2014 , the Orange Grove affair marked the only time that a sitting Premier in Bob \u00a0 Carr had survived appearing before ICAC although Carr did retire mere months after the conclusion of ICAC 's investigation of the Orange Grove affair .

It was released for the Sega consoles , Sega Genesis and Sega Master System , and Sega 's handheld , Sega Game Gear . Developed internally by Tiertex Design Studios , the game was sponsored by Coca - Cola and the game featured both the company logo on a zeppelin above the scoreboard , as well as the company jingle . The game uses button mashing as the main part of gameplay , but in three events it is n't used ( archery , diving ) or is slow - paced ( swimming ) . Each computer athlete has a fictional name and nationality ( choosing from UK , France , Germany , Italy , Spain , United States , Japan and the Unified Team , everyone with its own anthem snippet ) and actual strengths and weaknesses : J. Balen , for instance , is a frequent 100 m and 110 m hurdles record breaker but only an average hammer thrower . Also , each computer - controlled player seems better in a particular event depending on his country : Germans usually take the top spots in archery , Italians on swimming , Russians on pole vault , Americans on sprinting and so on .

    "text": "The Togoland Campaign ( 9\u201326 August 1914 ) was a French and British invasion of the German colony of Togoland in west Africa , which began the West African Campaign of the First World War . German colonial forces withdrew from the capital Lom\u00e9 and the coastal province , to fight delaying actions on the route north to Kamina , where the Kamina Funkstation ( wireless transmitter ) linked the government in Berlin to Togoland , the Atlantic and South America . The main British and French force from the neighbouring colonies of Gold Coast and Dahomey , advanced from the coast up the road and railway , as smaller forces converged on Kamina from the north . The German defenders were able to delay the invaders for several days at the battles of Agbeluvhoe and Chra but surrendered the colony on 26 August 1914 . In 1916 , Togoland was partitioned by the victors and in July 1922 , British Togoland and French Togoland were established as League of Nations mandates . ",

    "text": "Charles Waddell Chesnutt ( June 20 , 1858 \u2013 November 15 , 1932 ) was an African - American author , essayist , political activist and lawyer , best known for his novels and short stories exploring complex issues of racial and social identity in the post - Civil War South . Many families of free people of color were formed in the colonial and early Federal period ; some attained education and property ; in addition there were many mixed - race slaves , who as freedmen after the war were part of the complex society of the South . Two of his books were adapted as silent films in 1926 and 1927 by the African - American director and producer Oscar Micheaux . Following the Civil Rights Movement during the 20th century , interest in the works of Chesnutt were revived . Several of his books were published in new editions , and he received formal recognition . A commemorative stamp was printed in 2008 . During the early 20th century in Cleveland , Chesnutt established what became a highly successful court reporting business , which provided his main income . He became active in the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People , writing articles supporting education as well as legal challenges to discriminatory laws . ",

    "text": "The Cranford Protocol or Cranford Agreement was an oral undertaking given in 1952 by the British Government to the residents of Cranford in London regarding the usage of the runways at London Heathrow Airport to reduce the impact of aircraft noise on local residents . Under normal operations the agreement prohibited take - off on the northern runway towards the east ( over London ) because of the proximity of Cranford to the east end of this runway ; however this runway could be used in exceptional cases , for example when the southern runway was not available for departures or when departure delays are excessive . Although no formal written agreement exists , the Government acknowledges that an oral undertaking was given by a senior government official at a meeting of the Cranford Residents ' and District Amenities Association on 31 July 1952 . The protocol is included in the Heathrow Manual of Air Traffic Services and the airport 's noise abatement notification , and thus is a part of the airport 's operating rules . On 15 January 2009 , the Labour Government announced that it was ending the Cranford Agreement as part of the controversial expansion of London Heathrow Airport . Although in May 2010 the Coalition Government cancelled the Heathrow expansion plans , in September 2010 it reaffirmed the decision to end the Cranford Agreement . This decision was welcomed by the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead , to the west . To the east , the London Borough of Hounslow called for mitigation or compensation to be offered by BAA to those affected by ending the Cranford Agreement . In May 2013 Heathrow Airport Holdings ( who own and operate the airport ) submitted planning permission to the London Borough of Hillingdon to build new access taxiways , which would allow the implementation of full runway alternation on easterly operations . This permission was rejected in March 2014 ; Heathrow Airport appealed with a planning enquiry in June 2015 . On 2 February 2017 the Planning Inspectorate recommended that the appeal be allowed and planning permission granted . The decision has not yet been implemented as the airport is considering the Governments airspace management proposals for London and their own plans for expansion . ",

The name comes from a beautiful convent of Capuchin nuns whose garden was on the south side of the boulevard prior to the French Revolution . The former name , Rue Basse - du - Rempart ( \" bottom - of - the - wall street \" in French ) , suggests that , in the beginning , the street paralleled the city wall of Paris . Then , when the wall was destroyed , the street was widened and became a boulevard . Piet Mondrian 's little known story De groote boulevards ( Les Grands Boulevards ) , written in 1920 in Paris at the instance of Theo van Doesburg , was inspired by the Boulevard des Capucines . ",

    "text": "Pangaea Ultima ( also called Pangaea Proxima , Neopangaea , and Pangaea II ) is a possible future supercontinent configuration . Consistent with the supercontinent cycle , Pangaea Ultima could occur within the next 250 million years . This potential configuration , hypothesized by Christopher Scotese , earned its name from its similarity to the previous Pangaea supercontinent . Scotese later renamed Pangaea Ultima ( Last Pangaea ) to Pangaea Proxima ( Next Pangaea ) to alleviate confusion about the name Pangaea Ultima which could imply that it would be the last supercontinent . The concept was based on examination of past cycles of formation and breakup of supercontinents , not on current understanding of the mechanisms of tectonic change , which are too imprecise to project that far into the future . \" It 's all pretty much fantasy to start with , \" Scotese has said . \" But it 's a fun exercise to think about what might happen . And you can only do it if you have a really clear idea of why things happen in the first place . \" Supercontinents describe the merger of all , or nearly all , of the Earth 's landmass into a single contiguous continent . In the Pangaea Ultima scenario , subduction at the western Atlantic , east of the Americas , leads to the subduction of the Atlantic mid - ocean ridge followed by subduction destroying the Atlantic and Indian basin , causing the Atlantic and Indian Oceans to close , bringing the Americas back together with Africa and Europe . As with most supercontinents , the interior of Pangaea Proxima would probably become a semi - arid desert prone to extreme temperatures . ",

    "text": "Alice Bunker Stockham ( November 8 , 1833 in Cardington , Ohio \u2013 December 3 , 1912 in Alhambra , California ) was an obstetrician and gynecologist from Chicago and the fifth woman to become a doctor in the United States . She promoted gender equality , dress reform , birth control , and male and female sexual fulfillment for successful marriages . A well - traveled and well - read person who counted among her friends Leo Tolstoy and Havelock Ellis , she also visited Sweden and from her trips to schools there she brought back the idea of teaching children domestic crafts , thus single - handedly establishing shop and home economics classes in the United States . Stockham lectured against the use of corsets by women , made public endorsements of the healthiness of masturbation for both men and women ( still controversial when echoed by U.S. Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders more than 100 years later ) , advocated complete abstinence from alcohol and tobacco , and believed in women 's rights . Stockham was very concerned with the economic plight of divorced women with children and prostitutes who wanted to get off the street . She felt that these women had no marketable skills and would be unable to support themselves , so she had copies of her book Tokology , a layperson 's guide to gynecology and midwifery , privately printed and gave them to \" unfortunate women \" to sell door - to - door in Chicago . Each copy came with a bound - in certificate signed by Stockham and entitling the bearer to a free gynecological exam . In 1905 , a then 72-year old Stockham and her publisher were convicted of circulating improper literature under the Comstock laws . ",

    "text": "\" Teardrops \" is a song by English rock musician George Harrison from his 1981 album Somewhere in England . It was also issued as the second single off the album , in July 1981 . As with the lead single , \" All Those Years Ago \" , Harrison completed the song after Warner Bros. Records had rejected his initial submission of Somewhere in England in September 1980 . In response to Warner 's concerns , he wrote \" Teardrops \" as an attempt at a commercially oriented song . Harrison recorded the song at his Friar Park studio in England with Ray Cooper as his co - producer . Despite some reviewers predicting it as a hit , the single failed to achieve commercial success . In the United States , it peaked at number 102 on Billboards Bubbling Under the Hot 100 chart and number 88 on the Cash Box Top 100 . ",

It contains a triangular base plate and 281 dice of four different colours , and a rule book that gives rules for some 50 + games . Most of the games are centered on building or demolishing pyramids of dice , but there are also racing games and games of skill . The game has been originally published by Diego Rodriguez ( Reinhold Wittig ) , G\u00f6ttingen , in 1979 . The Game won the 1980 Spiel des Jahres special award for \" most beautiful game \" . In his preface Wittig writes : I 've often been asked how you go about it to invent a game . I want to add one answer now . Is perhaps the best answer possible to show the many different ways of designing a game . The answer is also a challenge : Invent rules of your own to my dice pyramid . The first edition of the game was a small version of the dice pyramid , without any rules . Over time , players contributed their own rules to a collection . ",

    "text": "The vesper sparrow ( Pooecetes gramineus ) is a medium - sized American sparrow . It is the only member of the genus Pooecetes . Adults have light brown upperparts and light underparts , both with darker streaking . They have a white eye ring and a long dark brown tail which shows white outer feathers in flight . Their breeding habitat is open grassy areas across most of North America . The nest is an open cup on the ground under a clump of grass . These birds migrate to the southern and central United States and Mexico . These birds forage on the ground , mainly eating insects and seeds . Outside the nesting season they often feed in small flocks . The male sings from a higher perch , such as a shrub or fencepost , which indicates his ownership of the nesting territory . The musical song begins with two pairs of repeated whistled notes and ends in a series of trills , somewhat similar to that of the song sparrow . This bird 's numbers are declining in the eastern parts of its range due to habitat loss . ",

The smelter in Trail , British Columbia was historically operated by the Consolidated Mining and Smelting Company ( COMINCO ) until COMINCO merged with Teck in 2001 , and has processed lead and zinc since 1896 . Smoke from the smelter caused damage to forests and crops in the surrounding area and also across the Canada \u2013 US border in Washington . The smoke from the smelter distressed residents , resulting in complaints to COMINCO and demands for compensation . The dispute between the smelter operators and affected landowners could not be resolved , resulting in the case being sent to an arbitration tribunal . Negotiation and resulting litigation and arbitration was settled in 1941 . ",

    "text": "\" All Together Now \" is a song by Liverpudlian band The Farm from their album Spartacus , and links some of the band 's favourite themes : socialism , brotherhood and football . Peter Hooton wrote the lyrics in his early 20s after reading about the Christmas truce of 1914 . The song was first recorded under the title \" No Man 's Land \" for a John Peel session in 1983 . In 1990 , Hooton wrote the chorus after Steve Grimes suggested putting the lyrics of No Man 's Land to the chord progression of Pachelbel 's Canon . To shorten the song for radio , the producer Suggs cut the song to three verses from its original six . It has been used by numerous football teams since , as well as by the Labour Party ( UK ) for their 2017 General Election campaign , often played during rallies . ",

It is located in Wrangell - Saint Elias National Park about east of Mount Blackburn , the second highest volcano in the United States , and southeast of the massive Nabesna Glacier . Regal Mountain is the third highest thirteener ( a peak between 13,000 and 13,999 feet in elevation ) in Alaska , ranking just behind its neighbor , Atna Peaks . Because the mountain is almost entirely covered in glaciers , no geological studies have been done , but published references state and the geological map shows that the mountain is an old eroded volcanic edifice . Several major glaciers flow from the steep and heavily eroded flanks of Regal Mountain . The Rohn Glacier and Regal Glacier head east and southeast to join the Nizina Glacier , while the Root Glacier flows south to join the Kennicott Glacier just above the town of McCarthy . Each of those large glaciers exceeds in width , but largest of all on Regal Mountain is a massive unnamed glacier , over across , which flows northwest just over to join the mighty Nabesna . ",

    "text": "Le Ventre de Paris ( 1873 ) is the third novel in \u00c9mile Zola 's twenty - volume series Les Rougon - Macquart . It is set in and around Les Halles , the enormous , busy central market of 19th - century Paris . Les Halles , rebuilt in cast iron and glass during the Second Empire was a landmark of modernity in the city , the wholesale and retail center of a thriving food industry . Le Ventre de Paris ( translated into English under many variant titles but literally meaning The Belly of Paris ) is Zola 's first novel entirely on the working class . The protagonist is Florent , an escaped political prisoner mistakenly arrested after the French coup of 1851 . He returns to his step - brother Quenu , a charcutier and his wife Lisa Quenu ( formerly Macquart ) , with whom he finds refuge . They get him a job in the market as a fish inspector . After getting mixed up in an ineffectual socialist plot against the Empire , Florent is arrested and deported again . Although Zola had yet to hone his mastery of working - class speech and idioms displayed to such good effect in L'Assommoir , the novel conveys a powerful atmosphere of life in the great market halls and of working class suffering . There are a number of vivid descriptive passages , the most famous of which , his description of the olfactory sensations experienced upon entering a cheese shop , has become known as the \" Cheese Symphony \" due to its ingenious orchestral metaphors . Throughout the book , the painter Claude Lantier , a relative of the Macquarts and later the protagonist of L'\u0152uvre ( 1886 ) - shows up to provide a semi - authorial commentary , playing the role of chorus . It is an interesting and often powerful work , though not usually considered as being on a par with the novelist 's achievements later in the Rougon - Macquart cycle . ",

He was nicknamed \" Iron Tigran \" due to his almost impenetrable defensive playing style , which emphasised safety above all else . Petrosian was a Candidate for the World Championship on eight occasions ( 1953 , 1956 , 1959 , 1962 , 1971 , 1974 , 1977 and 1980 ) . He won the World Championship in 1963 ( against Mikhail Botvinnik ) , successfully defended it in 1966\u2014against Boris Spassky \u2014 and lost it to Spassky in 1969 . Thus he was the defending World Champion or a World Championship Candidate in ten consecutive three - year cycles . He won the Soviet Championship four times ( 1959 , 1961 , 1969 , and 1975 ) . Petrosian is widely known for popularizing chess in Armenia . ",

    "text": "Oliver & Company is a 1988 American animated musical comedy - drama film produced by Walt Disney Feature Animation and released on November 18 , 1988 , by Walt Disney Pictures . The 27th Disney animated feature film , the film is based on the classic Charles Dickens novel Oliver Twist , which has been adapted many other times for the screen . In the film , Oliver is a homeless kitten who joins a gang of dogs to survive in the streets . Among other changes , the setting of the film was relocated from 19th century London to modern - day New York City , Fagin 's gang is made up of dogs ( one of which is Dodger ) , and Sykes is a loan shark . Following the release of The Black Cauldron , Michael Eisner and Jeffrey Katzenberg held a pitch meeting with the animation staff , in which story artist Pete Young pitched the idea to adapt Oliver Twist with dogs . The pitch was quickly approved , and the film quickly went into production under the working title Oliver and the Dodger . Released on the same day as The Land Before Time , Oliver & Company was a box office success , but it received mixed reviews from film critics . The film was re - released in the United States , Canada , and the United Kingdom on March 29 , 1996 . It was then released on home video later that same year , and again in 2002 and 2009 on DVD . The film was released on Blu - ray Disc in 2013 , commemorating its 25th Anniversary . ",

    "text": "Nexus \u00a0 Q is a discontinued digital media player developed by Google . Unveiled at the Google I / O developers ' conference on June 2012 , the device was expected to be released to the public in the United States shortly thereafter for US$ 300 . The Nexus Q was designed to leverage Google 's online media offerings , such as Google Play Music , Google Play Movies & TV , and YouTube , to provide a \" shared \" experience . Users could stream content from the supported services to a connected television , or speakers connected to an integrated amplifier , using their Android device and the services ' respective apps as a remote control for queueing content and controlling playback . The Nexus \u00a0 Q received mixed reviews from critics following its unveiling . While its unique spherical design was praised , the Nexus Q was criticized for its lack of functionality in comparison to similar devices such as Apple TV , including a lack of third - party content services , no support for streaming content directly from other devices using the DLNA standard , as well as other software issues that affected the usability of the device . The unclear market positioning of the Nexus Q was also criticized , as it carried a significantly higher price than competing media players with wider capabilities ; The New York Times technology columnist David Pogue described the device as being ' wildly overbuilt ' for its limited functions . The Nexus \u00a0 Q was given away at no cost to attendees of Google I / O 27 - 29 June 2012 , but the product 's consumer launch was postponed in July 2012 , purportedly to collect additional feedback . Those who had pre - ordered the Nexus \u00a0 Q following its unveiling received the device at no cost . The Nexus \u00a0 Q was quietly shelved in January 2013 , and support for the device in the Google Play apps was phased out beginning in May 2013 . Some of the Nexus \u00a0 Q 's concepts were repurposed for a more - successful device known as Chromecast , which similarly allows users to wirelessly queue content for playback using functions found in supported apps , but is designed as a smaller HDMI dongle with support for third - party services .

Between 1744 and 1745 the inheritors of Wielopolski 's possessions reconstructed the palace following designs of architect Piotr Hi\u017c . The owner of the building soon became Franciszek Ksawery Branicki , who commissioned renovation work under Szymon Bogumi\u0142 Zug . In 1802 the palace was bought by Anna Jadwiga Sapie\u017cyna . Stanis\u0142aw Staszic would live in the palace until he died there in 1826 . In 1839 the palace became property of Andrzej Artur Zamoyski . The new owner commissioned reconstruction works headed by architect Enrico Marconi which gave the building 's present nature . During the January Uprising of 1863 , the house was plundered by the Imperial Army . During the interwar period the building housed the Ministry of Interior and Administration ( Poland ) . The palace was damaged during the Warsaw Uprising and rebuilt between 1948 and 1950 without modifying its architectural design . Presently , the palace houses the Faculty of Journalism and Politics of the University of Warsaw , the Institute of Applied Social Sciences , \" Artes - Liberales \" Faculty , Institute for Scientific Information and Bibliographic Studies of the Historical Faculty of the University of Warsaw .

It covers a large portion of the cities of Waterloo and Kitchener and the township of Wilmot , and some parts of the townships of Wellesley and North Dumfries . About 90 % of the water supply of the Regional Municipality of Waterloo is derived from groundwater of the Waterloo Moraine aquifer system . During late 1989 and early 1990 , groundwater contamination in Elmira forced the Region to shut down some well fields . As a result , new land use management guidelines and water protection measures have been enacted . The Waterloo Moraine is the largest of fourteen moraines in the Region , spanning approximately 400 square kilometres . It is an interlobate moraine , consisting primarily of sand and gravel . It contains large aquifers , which discharge into the Grand River and its tributaries and maintain a base water flow rate into that system . ",

    "text": "The Virgin and Child with St Anne and St John the Baptist , sometimes called The Burlington House Cartoon , is a drawing by Leonardo da Vinci . The drawing is in charcoal and black and white chalk , on eight sheets of paper glued together . Because of its large size and format the drawing is presumed to be a cartoon for a painting . No painting by Leonardo exists that is based directly on this cartoon . The drawing depicts the Virgin Mary seated on the knees of her mother , St Anne , while holding the Child Jesus as Jesus ' young cousin , St. John the Baptist , stands to the right . It currently hangs in the National Gallery in London . It was either executed in around 1499 \u2013 1500 , at the end of the artist 's first Milanese period , or around 1506 \u2013 1508 , when he was shuttling between Florence and Milan . The majority of scholars prefer the latter date , although the National Gallery and others prefer the former . ",

In 1945 was converted to Catholicism and entered the Benedictine Order , being dean of the Monks of Byzantine Rite in Nideralteich Abbey in Germany . Father Blashkevich was engaged in Catholic ecumenism with other Christian religions but he was also a critic of desacralisation of Catholic doctrine in relation to the dialogue with Protestant denominations and the real intentions of the Orthodox Christians in the ecumenism .

In the first Zuma administration he had been an MP and a controversial member of the Judicial Service Commission . He resigned as MP in 2017 . Up to 2015 he was Minister of Mineral Resources . Ramatlhodi claimed in 2017 that Eskom chairperson Ben Ngubane and chief executive Brian Molefe requested that he terminate Glencor 's mining licenses in an apparent ruse to facilitate the sale of its Optimum coal mine to the Gupta family . He was assigned to his subsequent ministerial post after he supposedly did not comply . He was axed in the cabinet reshuffle of March 2017 , allegedly without being given reasons . His position was taken by a known Zuma ally , the then Free State economic development MEC Mosebenzi Zwane . In the same reshuffle , finance minister Pravin Gordhan and his deputy , Mcebisi Jonas , were also replaced . ",

He authored several songs of great significance within the Cuban music . The first contact Noel Nincola had with music was in bosom of his family , because his father Isaac Nicola Romero was a guitar player and teacher , while his mother Eva Reyes was a violinist in the Orquesta Sinf\u00f3nica Nacional ( Cuba \u2019s National Symphonic Orchestra ) and a singer . Between the years 1954 and 1956 , he studied under the guidance of Douane Voth ( piccolo ) , and Mart\u00edn Qui\u00f1ones ( singing lessons ) . In the late 1960s and early 1970s , he was a student of Leo Brouwer , Juan El\u00f3segui , Federico Smith and Sergio Vitier , not in the traditional academic way but as part of a workshop that was known as the Grupo de Experimentaci\u00f3n Sonora del ICAIC ( a Group of Sound Experimentation that worked for the Cuban Institute of Cinematographic Art and Industry ) . Nicola died of cancer on August 7 , 2005 , at the age of 58 . ",

Native Americans used the river as transportation route and portage . When French explorers and missionaries arrived in the 1600s , in what was then the Illinois Country of New France , they named the waterway La Rivi\u00e8re des Plaines ( River of the Plane Tree ) as they felt that trees on the river resembled the European plane tree . The local Native Americans showed these early European explorers how to traverse waterways of the Des Plaines watershed to travel from Lake Michigan to the Mississippi River and its valley . ",

Until 1974 , the heads of state of the Ethiopian Empire were either Emperors or regents . From the coup d'\u00e9tat of the Derg leading to the fall of the Empire in September 1974 until March 1975 , the Derg considered the Crown Prince Asfaw Wossen as the nominal head of state \u2013 which the Crown Prince refused to accept . During this time , the Chairmen of the Derg , the leaders of the Derg , were to be considered as acting heads of state . After 21 March 1975 , the Derg military junta fully took over . Until the establishment of the People 's Democratic Republic of Ethiopia in 1987 , still dominated by Derg figures , Chairmen of the Derg have to be considered heads of state \u2013 but not presidents . After the fall of the Derg and the establishment of the Transitional Government of Ethiopia in 1991 , the first immediate President ( Meles Zenawi ) has to be considered an Interim President . Since the formal establishment of the office of President in 1987 , there have been 6 official presidents . The President is the head of state of Ethiopia . The current president is Sahle - Work Zewde , who is also the first female president of Ethiopia , elected on 25 October 2018 by members of the Federal Parliamentary Assembly . ",

    "text": "The Velislaus Bible or Velislav 's Bible ( Latin Velislai biblia picta ) is an illuminated manuscript of 1325 \u2013 1349 , which is in effect a picture - book of the Bible , as the text is limited to brief titles or descriptions of the 747 pictures from the Old Testament and the New Testament , from the writings about the Antichrist and from the legends of the saints , especially St Wenceslas . It is therefore an example of a Biblia pauperum , though not in the typical form , having many more images . Most of the illuminations are only in ink , though some colour is used . The manuscript is of 188 folios on parchment , with a page size of 307 x 245 mm . It is in the Czech National Library ( N\u00e1rodn\u00ed knihovna Cesk\u00e9 republiky ) , Prague . The codex was created by several artists probably for Velislav the Canon ( d. 1367 ) , the notary of John I of Bohemia and his son Charles IV , Holy Roman Emperor , who were both based in Prague . ",

Josephus tells us that \" Abraham contrived to settle them in colonies ; and they took possession of Troglodytis and the country of Arabia Felix ( Arabia the Happy ) , as far as it reaches to the Red Sea . \" Abraham , in all probability , tried to keep them apart from Isaac to avoid conflict while fulfilling God 's commission to spread out and inhabit the globe .

    "text": "Kondor was the fifth of six Type 23 torpedo boats built for the German Navy ( initially called the Reichsmarine and then renamed as the Kriegsmarine in 1935 ) . The boat made multiple non - intervention patrols during the Spanish Civil War in the late 1930s . During World War II , she played a minor role in the attack on Oslo , the capital of Norway , during the Norwegian Campaign of 1940 . Kondor spent the next several months escorting minelayers as they laid minefields and damaged heavy ships back to Germany before she was transferred to France around September . She started laying minefields herself that month and continued to do so for the rest of the war . The boat returned to France in 1942 and helped to escort blockade runners , commerce raiders and submarines through the English Channel and the Bay of Biscay . Damaged by a mine shortly before the Allied Invasion of Normandy in June 1944 , Kondor was under repair on the day of the landings . Recognizing that she could not be repaired quickly , the boat was decommissioned later that month and was then further damaged by British bombers so that she was declared a constructive total loss .

Born in Rio de Janeiro , he was the eldest child of Emperor Dom Pedro \u00a0 II and Dona Teresa Cristina of the Two Sicilies , and thus a member of the Brazilian branch of the House of Braganza . Afonso died from epilepsy at the age of two , devastating the emperor . The following year , Pedro and Teresa Cristina had another son , Pedro Afonso , but he too died in infancy . After the loss of his second son , doubts grew in Pedro \u00a0 II 's mind that the imperial system could be viable . He still had an heir in his daughter Isabel , but he was unconvinced that a female would prove to be a suitable successor . He showed less concern about the effects his policies had on the monarchy , provided his daughter Isabel with no training for her role as potential empress , and failed to cultivate her acceptance within the country 's political class . Pedro \u00a0 II 's lack of interest in protecting the imperial system ultimately led to its downfall . ",

Established by act of Congress on July 11 , 1798 , it is the oldest of the United States military bands and the oldest professional musical organization in the United States . Today , the Marine Band also includes the Marine Chamber Orchestra and Marine Chamber Ensembles . The Marine Band is entirely separate from its sister military band , the United States Marine Drum and Bugle Corps ( \" The Commandant 's Own \" ) and the 10 active duty Marine Corps field bands . The Marine Band has been uniquely known as \" The President 's Own \" since 1801 due to the historic connection to the President of the United States . The relationship between the Marine Band and the White House began on New Year 's Day 1801 , when President John Adams invited the band to perform at the Executive Mansion . Later that year , Thomas Jefferson initiated the tradition of Marine Band performances by requesting that it perform at his inauguration . The Marine Band has played at every United States presidential inauguration since . President Thomas Jefferson gave the title \" The President 's Own \" in 1801 . Today , the Marine Band performs in approximately 500 events every year including state funerals , state arrival ceremonies , state dinners , parades , concerts , and other social events . The Marine Band also travels across the country each October and November during its fall concert tour , a tradition that began in 1891 under its most famous director , composer John Philip Sousa .

It is a compilation including their biggest worldwide hits , such as \" Mamma Mia \" , \" Upside Down \" , \" Halfway Around the World \" , \" Floorfiller \" , and many others . Every track included on the album ( except for the new tracks ) reached the Top 20 in at least one country . The album was planned to be released in early 2004 , but due to problems with Stockholm Records / Universal Music , A - Teens released the album on May 5 , 2004 . For the release of this album , the A - Teens called all their fans through their website asking for pictures , and they included the pictures on the booklet of the album . The tracks \" The Final Cut \" and \" With or Without You \" were written by the members of the band , giving messages of \" goodbye \" and \" thanks \" to their fans . This album was not released worldwide . Instead , it was released in selected territories where Universal thought it would do well . These included Mexico , Argentina , Germany , and some other European and Asian countries . The album went on to sell over 10,000 copies in Argentina and another 3,000 in Brazil ; overall , the album sold relatively well in Latin America and some parts of Europe , where \" I Promised Myself \" was a huge hit . An American edition was planned for this album , and it was going to be released through Interscope Records in late 2004 . However , the A - Teens were already finishing their Greatest Hits Tour in Sweden and they did n't want to promote in America as Dhani was about to release his first solo single there , so Interscope cancelled the release .

    "text": "Francesco De Masi ( 11 January 1930 \u2013 6 November 2005 ) was an Italian conductor and film score composer . He studied composition at the San Pietro a Maiella Conservatory in Naples , under the guidance of Achille Longo , his uncle . De Masi became interested in film music when Longo was asked to compose a soundtrack for a film , and he asked De Masi to be his assistant . De Masi 's filmography includes scores for over 200 films and TV series , ranging from spaghetti westerns and sword and sandal epics to gialli and horror films , such as Lucio Fulci 's Lo squartatore di New York ( The New York Ripper ) . De Masi also scored several action films , such as Enzo G. Castellari 's Quel maledetto treno blindato ( The Inglorious Bastards ) , but he is best remembered for his work on spaghetti westerns . Unlike most other composers , De Masi started writing western scores slightly earlier than the genre 's most influential musician , Ennio Morricone . As De Masi 's music was less influenced by Morricone , his style had a distinctive sound . Many of his songs were performed by the low - voiced member of the I Cantori Moderni choir , Ettore \" Raoul \" Lovecchio . De Masi was also very interested in classical music . He taught at the Santa Cecilia Conservatory , also conducting the conservatory 's orchestra . In an interview , De Masi listed Palestrina , Karlheinz Stockhausen , Ravel and Shostakovich as his main classical influences . De Masi died of cancer at the age of 75 . ",

    "text": "Extreme Makeover : Home Edition ( EM : HE ; sometimes informally referred to as Extreme Home Makeover ) is an American reality television series providing home improvements for less fortunate families and community schools . The show was hosted by former model , carpenter and veteran television personality Ty Pennington . Each episode features a family that has faced some sort of recent or ongoing hardship such as a natural disaster or a family member with a life - threatening illness , in need of new hope . The show 's producers coordinate with a local construction contractor , which then coordinates with various companies in the building trades for a makeover of the family 's home . This includes interior , exterior and landscaping , performed in seven days while the family is on vacation ( paid for by the show 's producers ) and documented in the episode . If the house is beyond repair , they replace it entirely . The show 's producers and crew film set and perform the makeover but do not pay for it . The materials and labor are donated . Many skilled and unskilled volunteers assist in the rapid construction of the house . EM : HE is considered a spin - off of Extreme Makeover , an earlier series providing personal makeovers ( often including plastic surgery ) to selected individuals . Unusual for a spin - off , Home Edition outlasted its mother show by several seasons . This show displays extreme changes to help recreate someone 's space . However , the format differs considerably ; in the original Extreme Makeover , for instance , participants were not necessarily chosen based on any recent hardship , whereas the family 's backstory is an important component of Home Edition . EM : HE also has similarities to other home renovation series such as Trading Spaces , on which Pennington was previously a key personality . The series was produced by Endemol USA ( the people behind Big Brother , Fear Factor , Deal or No Deal , Wipeout , and other reality shows ) in association with Disney - ABC Television Group 's Greengrass Television . The Executive Producers were Brady Connell and George Verschoor . The program originally aired on Sunday evenings but was moved to Friday nights as of October 21 , 2011 . Upon the airing of its final episode in series form , and for the 2012 special holiday run , it remained ABC 's last series to air solely in standard definition and never converted to a high definition or widescreen presentation . On December 15 , 2011 , ABC announced that Extreme Makeover : Home Edition would end its run on January 13 , 2012 . It will , however , continue to air as a special on the network . ",

The formation of the Committee was preceded by a call from the Social Democratic Left Party published in Politiken in February 1918 to mobilize protests around the country to counter the official Swedish government position on the Finnish question . The Committee sought to unite the Swedish labour movement for a common position against what they termed the \u201d White Terror \u201d in Finland . The Committee raised funds for humanitarian aid to the victims of the repression . The Committee also opposed denials of political asylum for Finnish refugees . Sven Linderot was one of the three members of the Committee . The Committee managed to gather 21,851.53 kronor , 14,518.73 for Finnish refugees in Sweden and 6,920 kronor for affected in Finland . The Committee published 100,000 leaflets titled ' Truth about Finland ' , and more than 100 public meetings were organized . ",

Its formulation was continued in their follow - up work , A Thousand Plateaus . Schizoanalysis acquires many different definitions during the course of its development in their collaborative work and individually in the work of Guattari . In Chaosmosis , Guattari explains that \" rather than moving in the direction of reductionist modifications which simplify the complex \" , schizoanalysis \" will work towards its complexification , its processual enrichment , towards the consistency of its virtual lines of bifurcation and differentiation , in short towards its ontological heterogeneity \" .

    "text": "Berge Meere und Giganten ( Mountains Seas and Giants ) is a 1924 science fiction novel by German author Alfred D\u00f6blin . Stylistically and structurally experimental , the novel follows the development of human society into the 27th century and depicts global - scale conflicts between future polities , technologies , and natural forces , culminating in the catastrophic harvesting of Iceland 's volcanic energy in order to melt Greenland 's ice cap . Among critics , Berge Meere und Giganten has the reputation of being a difficult and polarizing novel , and has not received nearly as much attention as D\u00f6blin 's following novel , Berlin Alexanderplatz ( 1929 ) . Inspired by the mundane sight of pebbles rolling in the Baltic Sea surf in the summer of 1921 , D\u00f6blin began writing Berge Meere und Giganten that fall , conducting extensive research into various natural and human sciences in the process . Although he had originally conceived of it as a hymn to the city and technology , over the course of writing the novel it evolved into a tribute to the power of nature . He finished the manuscript in the summer of 1923 , and it was published by Fischer Verlag the following year . ",

Produced by Gloria Katz and written by Huyck and Katz , with George Lucas as executive producer , the screenplay was originally intended to be an animated film based on the Marvel comic book of the same name , but the film adaptation became live - action because of a contractual obligation . Although several TV adaptations of Marvel characters had aired during the preceding 21 years , this was the first theatrically released feature film , coming after the serial Captain America . Lucas proposed adapting the comic book following the production of American Graffiti ( 1973 ) . Following multiple production difficulties and mixed response to test screenings , Howard the Duck was released in theaters on August 1 , 1986 . Upon its release , the film was a critical and commercial failure , and in the years since , was considered one of the worst films of all time . It was nominated for seven Razzie Awards , and made about $ 15 million domestically compared to its $ 30 million budget . Despite the criticism , it has gained a cult following among fans of the comic - book series . ",

Warner has said that his focus is on the political aspects of Islamic doctrine related to kafirs ( non - Muslims ) rather than on the beliefs of contemporary Muslims . His books are based on the premise that Islam as a religion and what he refers to as Political Islam should be clearly delineated . Islam as a faith is an individual \u2019s private decision and it should be treated with respect and tolerance . Warner defines \" political Islam , \" which he also calls Islamism , \" as a belief that Islam should control society and politics , not simply personal religious life . \" ",

    "text": "Odessa is the sixth studio album by the Bee Gees , originally released on 30 March 1969 . Regarded as the most significant of the group 's Sixties albums , it was released as a double vinyl record initially in an opulent red flocked cover with gold lettering . An ambitious project , originally intended as a concept album on the loss of a fictional ship in 1899 , it created tension and disagreements in the band regarding the album 's direction ; finally , a dispute over which song to release as a single led to Robin Gibb temporarily leaving the group . The album was not well received by the public or the music press on release , and led to a decline in the group 's fortunes until their disco period in the mid 1970s . Released in March 1969 by Polydor Records in the UK and Atco Records in the US , it was the group 's fourth album released internationally , their sixth overall , and their only double album of original music . Odessa would be the final album for the band 's original incarnation , and this was the last album to include guitarist Vince Melouney . The album contains \" First of May \" , \" Lamplight \" , \" Marley Purt Drive \" and \" Melody Fair \" . The album was reissued as a single - disc in 1976 when interest was revived in the Bee Gees career , since then the album has gained increasing critical acclaim ; it was reissued again in 2009 as a deluxe 3 disc set , and is included in 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die .

Three major products from Altsys for PC / Macintosh and NeXT were : Fontographer for Windows and Mac OS - font editor Font - O - Matic for Windows - font transformer Virtuoso for NeXT / OpenSTEP and Solaris - vector editor ( a version was announced , advertised and demonstrated for Windows NT , but never released ) Altsys ' best known product was basically a rebranded Virtuoso licensed to Aldus Corporation under the FreeHand name , was a vector drawing program that competed with Adobe Illustrator . It was published for many years , originally only on the Macintosh , then also for Microsoft Windows . When Aldus was acquired by Adobe , the licensing agreement that Altsys had with Aldus precluded FreeHand from being part of the deal , so the publishing rights reverted to Altsys . Altsys also published Metamorphosis for Macintosh , a font utility . Altsys was acquired by Macromedia in January , 1995 . Von Ehr became a major Macromedia shareholder and joined the Macromedia board of directors . ",

    "text": "Giuseppe Barattolo ( 1882 \u2013 1949 ) was an Italian lawyer , politician and film producer . In 1913 , during the silent era , Barattolo founded Caesar Film . Caesar made a series of popular films , some of which starred Francesca Bertini . In 1919 he joined and became an influential figure at the conglomerate Unione Cinematografica Italiana which dominated Italian film production during the early 1920s , but this came to an end following the box office failure of Quo Vadis ( 1924 ) . In the early 1930s he tried to re - establish Caesar Film as a serious force in Italian production , but this also failed . During the 1930s , Barattolo lobbied the Fascist government of Italy for aid to rebuild the Italian film industry . He was a strong supporter of the government 's plans during the mid-1930s to invest large amounts of money constructing Cinecitt\u00e0 studios in Rome , and during the era he worked at the state - backed Scalera Film . Barattolo was instrumental in attempts to rebuild the Italian film industry in Venice during the Italian Social Republic . After the fall of Benito Mussolini Barattolo worked as an independent producer . ",

    "text": "In Christianity , worship is reverent honor and homage paid to God . In the New Testament various words are used for worship . The word proskuneo \" to worship \" means to bow down to God or kings . Throughout most of Christianity 's history , corporate Christian worship has been liturgical , characterized by prayers and hymns , with texts rooted in , or closely related to , the Scripture , particularly the Psalter ; this form of sacramental and ceremonial worship is still practiced by the Roman Catholic , Eastern Orthodox , and Anglican churches , as well as some Protestant denominations such as Lutheranism and Methodism . In Evangelicalism , worship is viewed like an act of adoration of God , with a more informal conception . The term liturgy is derived from the Greek leitourgia meaning \" public service \" and is formed by two words : \" laos \" ( people ) and \" ergon \" ( work ) , literally \" work of the people \" . Responsorial prayers are a series of petitions read or sung by a leader with responses made by the congregation . Set times for prayer during the day were established ( based substantially on Jewish models ) , and a festal cycle throughout the Church year governed the celebration of feasts and holy days pertaining to the events in the life of Jesus , the lives of the saints , and aspects of the Godhead . A great deal of emphasis was placed on the forms of worship , as they were seen in terms of the Latin phrase lex orandi , lex credendi ( \" the rule of prayer is the rule of belief\")\u2014that is , the specifics of one 's worship express , teach , and govern the doctrinal beliefs of the community . According to this view , alterations in the patterns and content of worship would necessarily reflect a change in the faith itself . Each time a heresy arose in the Church , it was typically accompanied by a shift in worship for the heretical group . Orthodoxy in faith also meant orthodoxy in worship , and vice versa . Thus , unity in Christian worship was understood to be a fulfillment of Jesus ' words that the time was at hand when true worshipers would worship \" in spirit and in truth \" ( John 4:23 ) . ",

He was a professor at the Colegio de San Nicol\u00e1s Obispo in Valladolid and was ousted in 1792 . He served in a church in Colima and then in Dolores , Dias . After his arrival , he was shocked by the rich soil he had found . He tried to help the poor by showing them how to grow olives and grapes , but in Mexico , growing these crops was discouraged or prohibited by the authorities due to Spanish imports of the items . In 1810 he gave the famous speech , \" The Cry of Dolores \" , calling upon the people to protect the interest of their King Fernando VII ( held captive by Napoleon ) by revolting against the European - born Spaniards who had overthrown the Spanish Viceroy . He marched across Mexico and gathered an army of nearly 90,000 poor farmers and Mexican civilians who attacked and killed both Spanish Peninsulares and Criollo elites , even though Hidalgo 's troops lacked training and were poorly armed . These troops ran into an army of 6,000 well - trained and armed Spanish troops ; most of Hidalgo 's troops fled or were killed at the Battle of Calder\u00f3n Bridge . ",

The governor appoints the chief minister , whose council of ministers are collectively responsible to the assembly . Given the confidence of the assembly , the chief minister 's term is for five years and is subject to no term limits . Following Madhya Pradesh 's reorganisation on 1 November 1956 , 17 people have served as its chief minister . Eleven of these belonged to the Indian National Congress , including the inaugural officeholder Ravishankar Shukla . The first non - Congress chief minister was Govind Narayan Singh who defected from the party and lead a Samyukta Vidhayak Dal government from 1967 to 1969 . Digvijaya Singh of the Congress became the first officeholder to serve two full five - year terms . He was succeeded by Uma Bharti of the Bharatiya Janata Party , Madhya Pradesh 's only woman chief minister .

    "text": "In gridiron football , a triple - threat man is a player who excels at all three of the skills of running , passing , and kicking . In modern usage , such a player would be referred to as a utility player . Triple - threat men were the norm in the early days of football , as substitution rules were stringent . Thus , in addition to the need for passing , running , and kicking skills , they were also required to play defense . As injury awareness grew and substitution rules loosened , teams shifted to kicking specialists , which made the triple - threat man obsolete . One of the last triple - threat men in professional football was George Blanda , a quarterback and kicker who last played for the Oakland Raiders of the National Football League in 1975 . Danny White , a quarterback and punter , retired in 1989 . Since then , non - specialists have placekicked only extremely infrequently in the NFL . One instance occurred when Doug Flutie \u2014 also adept at both running and passing as a \" scrambling \" quarterback \u2014 drop kicked an extra point in 2006 during the last play of his career . Danny White of the Dallas Cowboys was the last non - specialist to kick on a regular basis , as he served as the team 's starting quarterback and punter from 1980 until 1984 , after several years as backup to Roger Staubach . There are , however , still dual - threat quarterbacks and wildcat halfbacks , who can both run and pass . A quarterback who played wide receiver in high school or college may sparingly catch passes or be converted into a wide receiver who occasionally passes . For over forty years the NFL single - season scoring record was held by a triple - threat man , Green Bay Packers Hall of Famer Paul Hornung . Hornung set a record of 176 points in 1960 by scoring fifteen touchdowns , kicking forty - one extra points , and also kicking fifteen field goals . ",

    "text": "Soggy biscuit ( also known as ookie cookie , limp biscuit , wet biscuit , shoot the cookie , or cum on a cookie ) is a male group masturbation activity where the participants stand around a biscuit ( UK ) or cookie ( US ) masturbating and ejaculating onto it ; the last person to do so must eat the biscuit . The game is reportedly played by adolescents , notably in the United Kingdom , the United States , and Australia . In Australia , it is also known as soggy Sao after the SAO brand of biscuits that are popular there . Although soggy biscuit is not necessarily associated with homosexuality , since the game does not require sexual contact , the idea and practice of the game is in keeping with the spirit of adolescent sexual exploration associated by many in the UK with public schools or in Australia with private schools . Although the terminology may differ slightly , the notability of the game is such that variations on the theme are referred to in popular culture , examples including Stephen Fry 's The Liar , the German film Crazy , the 2006 film Sleeping Dogs Lie , the episode of Blackadder II \" Chains \" , and the episode of Drawn Together , \" Freaks and Greeks \" . According to the book Law of the Playground , 1866 men were asked : \" How close have you got to the game of soggy biscuit , in which you race to wank onto a cracker ? \" Of the respondents , 6.2 % reportedly admitted to having played the game . In November 2011 , The Eagle - Tribune reported that police were investigating claims that two Andover High School ( Massachusetts ) basketball players were hazed by older team members into playing the game . In January 2012 , it was reported that two students were expelled over the incident and a further five were suspended . A grand jury was convened to determine if any of the students should be charged criminally . ",

He is best known for his command of the Central Task Force landings during Operation Torch , and his command of the II Corps during the early stages of the Tunisian Campaign . In February 1943 , while in command of the II Corps , his forces were defeated by German forces commanded by Generalfeldmarschall Erwin Rommel and Generaloberst Hans - J\u00fcrgen von Arnim in the Battle of Kasserine Pass . After this setback , Fredendall was relieved of command of II Corps by General Dwight D. Eisenhower , the Supreme Allied Commander in North Africa , and replaced by Major General George S. Patton Jr. in March 1943 . In spite of his relief , Fredendall was promoted to lieutenant general in June 1943 , assumed command of the Second Army and was greeted back home in the United States as a hero . ",

Later it runs through the Comarca of Alt Pened\u00e8s , where it feeds a reservoir in the nature reserve of Parc del Foix since 1928 , which is highly important for the drinking water supply of the densely populated coastal plain between Barcelona and Tarragona . Then it goes through the Comarca of Garraf from north to the south where it ends into the Mediterranean Sea west of the village of Cubelles . This little delta became an important natural reserve and recreational area after the campground \u2033Camping Paradiso\u2033 was removed in the late 1990s . For most of the year , the river is dried up because of the dam and because of hot - summer climatical reasons . That can suddenly change in the winter months when heavy rain comes down in the mountains . ",

A pipeline and canal extends across the border into Namibia , supplying towns as far away as Oshakati in Ovamboland with water . The dam was completed in 1976 . However , due to the onset of the Angolan civil war following independence , the full master plan for the scheme was not realised by the South African and Portuguese governments . ",

    "text": "The Winnebago War , also known as the Winnebago Uprising , was a brief conflict that took place in 1827 in the Upper Mississippi River region of the United States , primarily in what is now the state of Wisconsin . Not quite a war , the hostilities were limited to a few attacks on American civilians by a portion of the Winnebago ( or Ho - Chunk ) Native American tribe . The Ho - Chunks were reacting to a wave of lead miners trespassing on their lands , and to false rumors that the United States had sent two Ho - Chunk prisoners to a rival tribe for execution . Most Native Americans in the region decided against joining the uprising , and so the conflict ended after U.S. officials responded with a show of military force . Ho - Chunk chiefs surrendered eight men who had participated in the violence , including Red Bird , who American officials believed to be the ringleader . Red Bird died in prison in 1828 while awaiting trial ; two other men convicted of murder were pardoned by President John Quincy Adams and released . As a result of the war , the Ho - Chunk tribe was compelled to cede the lead mining region to the United States . The Americans also increased their military presence on the frontier , building Fort Winnebago and reoccupying two other abandoned forts . The conflict convinced some officials that Americans and Indians could not live peaceably together , and that the Natives should be compelled to move westward , a policy known as Indian removal . The Winnebago War preceded the larger Black Hawk War of 1832 , which involved many of the same people and concerned similar issues . ",

    "text": "Mar\u00eda de Buenos Aires is a tango operetta ( tango operita ) with music by \u00c1stor Piazzolla and libretto by Horacio Ferrer that premiered at the Sala Planeta in Buenos Aires on 8 May 1968 . The first part of the surreal plot centers on the experiences of a prostitute in Buenos Aires , Argentina ; the second part takes place after her death . The characters include Mar\u00eda ( and , after her death , the Shadow of Mar\u00eda ) , a singer of payadas ; various members of the Buenos Aires underworld ; a payador who functions as a poet and narrator ; a goblin - like duende ; several marionettes under the control of the duende ; a circus of psychoanalysts ; pasta makers ; and construction workers . Many elements of the libretto suggest parallels between Mar\u00eda and Mary , the mother of Jesus ( in Spanish , Mar\u00eda ) or Jesus himself . While certainly not in the narrow sense an opera ballet , because the dance is tango rather than classical ballet , it falls within the tradition of having set dance pieces integral to an operatic work . The music draws on the nuevo tango idiom for which Piazzolla is famous . The original idea for the story was conceived by Piazzolla 's lover at the time of its composition , Egle Martin , who was married to Eduardo \" Lalo \" Palacios . The title role was originally conceived for Martin , but while Piazzolla was still composing the operita , he and Martin broke up after he asked her husband for her hand at Christmas in 1967 . According to Martin , Piazzolla said to Lalo , \" She is music , she ca n't belong to anybody , no she is music , she is music , and that 's me . \" After their rift , a replacement was desperately needed , but Piazzolla soon met folksinger Amelita Baltar at the Buenos Aires nightclub Nuestro Tiempo , formerly known as \" 676 \" and once Piazzolla 's home base in Argentina . Baltar 's identification with the character Mar\u00eda , paired with her beauty and captivating stage presence , made her ideal for the role . The piece is written for at least three vocalists ( one of whom , the narrator , mainly speaks rather sings ) . For the orchestration Piazzolla augmented his current working quintet : Piazzolla ( bandone\u00f3n ) , Antonio Agri ( violin ) , Jamie \" El Russo \" Gosis ( piano ) , Oscar Lopez Ruiz ( guitar ) and Kicho D\u00edaz ( double bass ) ; with viola , cello , flute , percussion , vibraphone and xylophone , and a second guitar . Mar\u00eda de Buenos Aires has often been performed with dancers as well as musicians . There are several extant arrangements , including Piazzolla 's own and one by Pablo Ziegler . ",

He preferred to work collaboratively with liberal white groups in the South , quietly as a \" sideline activist , \" to get practical results . His position is often contrasted with that of W. E. B. Du Bois , who was a powerful and militant advocate for blacks and described Johnson as \" too conservative . \" During Johnson 's academic studies and leadership of Fisk University during the 1930s and 1940s , the South had legal racial segregation and Jim Crow discriminatory laws and practices , including having disfranchised most black voters in constitutions passed at the turn of the century . Johnson was unwavering in personal terms in his opposition to this oppressive system , yet worked hard to change race relations in terms of short - term practical gains . His grandson Jeh Johnson served as the United States Secretary of Homeland Security from 2013 to 2017 . ",

    "text": "Silvan ( wood elves ) are a type of Elves in J.R.R. Tolkien 's fictional universe of Middle - earth , mainly the Elves of Mirkwood and Lothl\u00f3rien . They are commonly known as Wood - elves . In the First Age the Elves of Ossiriand , or Laiquendi , were also referred to as wood - elves . Silvan Elves are mainly Nandor in descent but also mixed with Avari . Many of them were later ruled over by a small population of social elites who were Sindar ( Grey Elves ) or even Noldor ( High Elves ) . For example , Thranduil king of northern Mirkwood , as well as his son Legolas , were Sindarin Elves who ruled over a primarily Silvan population . Similarly Amd\u00edr and his son Amroth , the last Sindarin prince of Lorien , were Sindar . After Amroth was lost at sea , Galadriel and Celeborn came to rule over L\u00f3rien . Galadriel was a High Elf who belonged to the House of Finarfin , though she was actually of mixed Vanyar / Noldor / Telerin parentage , while Celeborn was also Sindarin ( Sindar being a subset of the Teleri ) . Silvan Elves are described as being less wise than other Eldar , and some of them are almost indistinguishable from the Avari , those who never joined the Great Journey . ",

    "text": "The Argentine heavy metal is a heavy metal music movement that originated in Argentina in the 1980s . The first popular artist was Pappo , who created the band Riff influenced by the contemporary new wave of British heavy metal . V8 was formed at that time as well , and most of its members created notable bands after their respective departures from the band : Ricardo Iorio and Walter Giardino , currently in Almafuerte and Rata Blanca , are still popular . The second half of the 1980s saw the success of hard rock bands such as Kamikaze , Alakran and Rata Blanca , with an aesthetic similar to the contemporary glam metal . Thrash metal bands , such as Herm\u00e9tica , Horcas and Lethal , appeared in the early 1990s . Rata Blanca declined its popularity in the 1990s and eventually broke up . Herm\u00e9tica became more popular than V8 during its short existence , and broke up in a controversy between the leader Ricardo Iorio and the other members . Iorio created a new band , Almafuerte , and the former members of Herm\u00e9tica stayed together for some time as Mal\u00f3n . Rata Blanca had a revival later , and the band was rejoined . ",

The battle of Samugarh was fought between his sons Dara Shikoh ( the eldest son and heir apparent ) and his two younger brothers Aurangzeb and Murad Baksh ( third and fourth sons of the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan ) . Dara Shikoh began to retreat towards Samugarh , about 10 miles ( 16 \u00a0 km ) east of Agra , India , south of the Yamuna River , after Aurangzeb had defeated Dara Shikoh 's forces during the Battle of Dharmat . Aurangzeb and his smaller but formidable army then flanked Dara \u2019s fortified line along the Chambal River by finding a little - known and unguarded ford . The battle was fought during northern India 's warmest season and Aurangzeb 's men were on the march for a very long while . The army of Aurangzeb arrived with yellow banners and flags and fortified their position in front of the heir apparent . Dara Shikoh then tried to protect his rear flank by erecting massive red tents and banners . ",

    "text": "The Sims class destroyers were built for the United States Navy , and commissioned in 1939 and 1940 . These twelve ships were the last United States destroyer class completed prior to the American entry into World War II . All Sims - class ships saw action in World War II , and seven survived the war . No ship of this class saw service after 1946 . They were built under the Second London Naval Treaty , in which the limit on destroyer standard displacement was lifted , but an overall limit remained . Thus , to maximize the number of destroyers and avoid developing an all - new design , the Sims class were only 70 tons larger as designed than previous destroyers . They are usually grouped with the 1500-ton classes and were the sixth destroyer class since production resumed with the Farragut class in 1932 . The class served extensively in World War II , and five of the class were lost in the war . Of the five ships lost , four were at the hands of the Japanese and one at the hands of the Germans . The class served on Neutrality Patrols in the Atlantic in 1940 - 41 . Except for Roe , Wainwright , and Buck , the class was transferred to the Pacific shortly after the attack on Pearl Harbor . All of the ships saw extensive combat service . At the war 's end in August 1945 , three of the seven survivors were undergoing overhauls that were left unfinished , and were ultimately scrapped . The remaining four seaworthy ships were used as targets during the 1946 Operation Crossroads atomic tests at Bikini Atoll . One was sunk by the first blast , while the other three were sunk as targets two years later after serving as experimental platforms . ",

The poet and novelist Robert Giraud , an expert on the Parisian underworld , introduced Jessua to L\u00e9on la Lune , a vagrant whose real name was Leon Boudeville , and suggested that they follow him from day to night . After completing the film Giraud showed it to the poet and screenwriter Jacques Pr\u00e9vert who wrote an introduction and asked Henri Crolla to contribute some music to the film .

The Master Chief is a towering biochemically and cybernetically - enhanced supersoldier , raised and trained from an early age to be a weapon ; he is almost faceless , never seen without his green - colored armor and helmet . He is commonly referred to by his naval rank , rather than his given birth - name or serial - designation . The character is voiced by Steve Downes , a Chicago disc jockey , in the video games in which he appears . Downes based his personification of the Chief on an initial character sketch which called for a Clint Eastwood \u2013 type character of few words . The Master Chief is a video game icon , a relative newcomer among more established franchise characters , such as Mario , Sonic the Hedgehog and Lara Croft . The character has received a mostly positive reception . While some have described the Chief 's silent and faceless nature as a weakness of the character , other publications have suggested these attributes better allow players to assume his role . ",

The song is inspired by urban music and features Cruz singing to his \" sweetheart with white skin \" while musing on their interracial relationship ( Cruz is black ) . He suggests that this could only have been made possible via the intrepid maritime history of their country , and sings about the spices and cultural knowledge that were brought back to Portugal as a result of this history . The song was performed sixteenth on the night , following the United Kingdom 's Love City Groove with \" Love City Groove \" and preceding Cyprus ' Alexandros Panayi with \" Sti Fotia \" . At the close of voting , it had received 5 points , placing 21st in a field of 23 . It was succeeded as Portuguese representative at the 1996 contest by L\u00facia Moniz with \" O meu cora\u00e7\u00e3o n\u00e3o tem cor \" . ",

    "text": "\" Two Doors Down \" was a song written and performed by Dolly Parton , which provided a 1978 U.S. country and pop hit for her . The song was sung from the perspective of a woman who has just broken up with her boyfriend and is debating attending a party two doors down the hall from her apartment . She decides to go , meets a new man and returns with him to her own apartment \" two doors down \" . It was included on Parton 's 1977 Here You Come Again album , but before Parton could release it as the album 's second single in March 1978 , singer Zella Lehr released a cover version that became a top ten U.S. country hit . While Lehr 's version was on the country charts , the title cut of Here You Come Again was becoming a much bigger pop hit than Parton had anticipated . Wanting to capitalize on her newfound pop success ( and also not wanting to compete with Lehr 's country version of the song ) Parton rerecorded a more loose , pop - oriented version of \" Two Doors Down \" with a slight disco flavoring . She released the new version on a double - A - sided single , with the other side , \" It 's All Wrong , but It 's All Right \" intended for country airplay , and \" Two Doors Down \" intended for the pop airplay . The single topped the U.S. country charts , and was a top-20 pop hit for Parton , and went on to be one of her most popular hits . Also in 1978 Joe Thomas did his own disco cover of this song . Parton also had the new version of \" Two Doors Down \" ( which omitted the first verse , and included an upbeat \" sing - along \" bridge ) replace the previous version on all subsequent pressings of Here You Come Again , making the earlier version something of a collectors ' item among Parton 's fans . The original version of \" Two Doors Down \" was subsequently issued on CD in 2000 on the 3-CD Australian compilation Legendary Dolly Parton , which is now out of print . In 2009 , Jill Johnson recorded the song on the cover album Music Row II . ",

NAVFORGER was responsible for all US naval activities in Germany . Its first commander was Vice Admiral Robert L. Ghormley ( 1944 \u2013 45 ) . After the formation of the command , it was first necessary to take under U.S. control the German warships assigned to the U.S. as war prizes ( for example , the heavy cruiser Prinz Eugen ) . To this end , in Bremerhaven , a Naval Service Unit ( MDG ) was established . After the initial , purely administrative order , the settlement of the German Kriegsmarine and the merchant navy was in cooperation with the other allies , finished , the command was greatly reduced . It was intended to completely dissolve the command in 1948 . However , the American military governor General Lucius D. Clay and since July 1948 COMNAVFORGER Rear Admiral Wilkes convinced the leadership in Washington to leave some naval forces in Germany . The now allotted backup and reconnaissance tasks were to deal with three main elements : the Naval Advanced Base Bremerhaven , the Rhine River Patrol and the Intelligence Unit stationed in Berlin . The tasks also included the supervision and management of commercial shipping on the inland waters of the United States Zone . ",

    "text": "The J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski Monument in Warsaw was erected to honor J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski , a military leader , Marshal of Poland and one of the main figures responsible for Poland 's regaining its independence . This tall , bronze and granite statue is located near Pi\u0142sudski 's Square and the Hotel Europejski , at Tokarzewski - Karaszewicz Street . It bears the inscriptions \" J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski \" and \" Marshal of Poland \" . Plans to raise the monument can be traced to 1990 , when the president of Warsaw Stanis\u0142aw Wyganowski endorsed the request of a group campaigning for the creation of a monument to Pi\u0142sudski . The monument , cast in the Polish Navy Shipyards , was unveiled on 14 August 1995 , on the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Warsaw , which was commanded by Pi\u0142sudski . The unveiling was attended by the President of Poland , Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa , and Pi\u0142sudski 's daughter , Jadwiga Pi\u0142sudska . The original plans called for the monument to be raised at Na Rozdro\u017cu Square , but were later modified to site it near the \u0141azienki . This decision was protested by the supporters of the monument , who declared the new location too minor , and the monument was moved to the current location . The current location has been and still is seen as controversial ; for example the statue 's designer , , expressed his opposition to it in a letter shortly before the monument was unveiled , pointing out that it would cause the monument to be isolated from most ceremonies that take place on the square . Others have specifically criticized the fact that the location of the monument causes Polish soldiers to often face away from it during the guard change ceremony at the nearby Tomb of the Unknown Soldier , Warsaw , and during the observances for Polish Independence Day , which they regard as disrespectful .

    "text": "The Ellerbusch Site ( 12-W-56 ) is a small but significant archaeological site in the southwestern part of the U.S. state of Indiana . Unlike many sites created by people of the same culture , it occupies an upland site near a major river floodplain . Its existence appears to have been the result of the coincidence of periods of peace and growth in the related Angel Site , which led some townspeople to leave their homes for new villages that were more convenient for resource gathering . Researched partly because of its small size , Ellerbusch has produced information that greatly increases present awareness of other small sites and of its culture 's overall patterns of settlement in the region . Because of its archaeological value , the site was declared a historic site in the late twentieth century . ",

    "text": "The French Resistance ( ) was the collection of French movements that fought against the Nazi German occupation of France and against the collaborationist Vichy r\u00e9gime during the Second World War . Resistance cells were small groups of armed men and women ( called the Maquis in rural areas ) , who , in addition to their guerrilla warfare activities , were also publishers of underground newspapers , providers of first - hand intelligence information , and maintainers of escape networks that helped Allied soldiers and airmen trapped behind enemy lines . The men and women of the Resistance came from all economic levels and political leanings of French society , including \u00e9migr\u00e9s , academics , students , aristocrats , conservative Roman Catholics ( including priests ) , and also citizens from the ranks of liberals , anarchists and communists . The French Resistance played a significant role in facilitating the Allies ' rapid advance through France following the invasion of Normandy on 6 June 1944 , and the lesser - known invasion of Provence on 15 August , by providing military intelligence on the German defences known as the Atlantic Wall and on Wehrmacht deployments and orders of battle . The Resistance also planned , coordinated , and executed acts of sabotage on the electrical power grid , transport facilities , and telecommunications networks . It was also politically and morally important to France , both during the German occupation and for decades afterward , because it provided the country with an inspiring example of the patriotic fulfillment of a national imperative , countering an existential threat to French nationhood . The actions of the Resistance stood in marked contrast to the collaboration of the French regime based at Vichy , the French people who joined the pro - Nazi Milice fran\u00e7aise and the French men who joined the Waffen SS . After the landings in Normandy and Provence , the paramilitary components of the Resistance were organised more formally , into a hierarchy of operational units known , collectively , as the French Forces of the Interior ( FFI ) . Estimated to have a strength of 100,000 in June 1944 , the FFI grew rapidly and reached approximately 400,000 by October of that year . Although the amalgamation of the FFI was , in some cases , fraught with political difficulties , it was ultimately successful , and it allowed France to rebuild the fourth - largest army in the European theatre ( 1.2 million men ) by VE Day in May 1945 .

He is also the namesake of Halin graphs , a class of planar graphs constructed from trees by adding a cycle through the leaves of the given tree ; earlier researchers had studied the subclass of cubic Halin graphs but Halin was the first to study this class of graphs in full generality . Halin earned his doctorate from the University of Cologne in 1962 , under the supervision of Klaus Wagner and Karl D\u00f6rge , after which he joined the faculty of the University of Hamburg . In February 1994 , a colloquium was held at the University of Hamburg in honor of Halin 's 60th birthday . ",

This heating system is the first of its kind in North America , although much larger systems have been built in northern Europe . The 52 homes in the community are heated with a solar district heating system that is charged with heat originating from solar collectors on the garage roofs and is enabled for year - round heating by underground seasonal thermal energy storage ( STES ) . The system was designed to model a way of addressing global warming and the burning of fossil fuels . The solar energy is captured by 800 solar thermal collectors located on the roofs of all 52 houses ' garages . It is billed as the first solar powered subdivision in North America , although its electricity and transportation needs are provided by conventional sources . In 2012 the installation achieved a world record solar fraction of 97 % ; that is , providing that amount of the community 's heating requirements with solar energy over a one - year time span . ",

    "text": "Jepht\u00e9 ( Jephtha ) is an opera by the French composer Michel Pignolet de Mont\u00e9clair . It takes the form of a trag\u00e9die en musique in a prologue and five acts ( because of its subject matter it was also styled a trag\u00e9die biblique ) . The libretto , by the Abb\u00e9 Simon - Joseph Pellegrin , is based on the Biblical story of Jephtha . The oratorio was first performed at the Acad\u00e9mie royale de musique , Paris on 28 February 1732 . It was the first opera in France using a story from the Bible to appear on a public stage . For this reason , Cardinal de Noailles banned performances of the work for a time . Mont\u00e9clair made revisions for revivals of the work in March 1732 and April 1737 . In 1735 , the soprano who had premiered Iphise , Catherine - Nicole Lemaure , was forced to appear in that year 's revival via threats of imprisonment if she would not do so ; therefore , she intentionally bombed the performance and was booed at by the audience . She was detained overnight at For - l'\u00c9v\u00eaque , a Parisian prison , until she returned the next night to sing the role correctly . ",

    "text": "The scimitar oryx or scimitar - horned oryx ( Oryx dammah ) , also known as the Sahara oryx , is a species of Oryx once widespread across North Africa which went extinct in the wild in 2000 . It has a long taxonomic history since its scientific description in 1816 by Lorenz Oken , who named it Oryx algazel . This antelope stands a little more than at the shoulder . The males weigh and the females weigh . The coat is white with a red - brown chest and black markings on the forehead and down the length of the nose . The calves are born with a yellow coat without distinguishing marks ; their coats change to adult coloration at 3\u201312 months old . The scimitar oryx formed herds of mixed sexes of up to 70 members , usually guided by the bulls . They inhabited semideserts and deserts and were adapted to live in the extreme heat , with their efficient cooling mechanism and very low requirement of water . Scimitar oryx feed on foliage , grasses , succulent plants and plant parts during the night or early morning . Births peak between March and October . After a gestation of eight to nine months , one calf is born . Soon after , the female has a postpartum estrus . The scimitar oryx was once widespread across northern Africa . Its decline began as a result of climate change during the neolithic period , and later it was hunted extensively for its horns . Today , it is bred in captivity in special reserves in Tunisia , Morocco and Senegal and on private exotic animal ranches in the Texas Hill Country . In 2016 a reintroduction program was launched and currently a small herd has been successfully reintroduced in Chad . The scimitar oryx was domesticated in Ancient Egypt and is believed to have been used as food and sacrificed as offerings to gods . Wealthy people in Ancient Rome also bred them . The use of their valuable hides began in the Middle Ages . The unicorn myth may have originated from sightings of a scimitar oryx with a broken horn . The scimitar oryx was the emblem of the ancient Egyptian Oryx nome and today is the animal symbol of the Sahara Conservation Fund . ",

    "text": "The Answer is Never is the second full - length album recorded by the band Howards Alias . The album was released by Household Name Records on June 7 , 2004 on compact disc . A huge leap in terms of quality of both songwriting and production in comparison to debut The Chameleon Script , this was the sound of a much more mature and less ska punk - influenced Howards Alias . As the band had become a quartet by this point , it was up to the multi - talented Nicholas Horne to play both trumpet and trombone during the recording process . This added a subtle irony to the fact that the album was touted as being ' closer to the live sound of Howards Alias ' , as did the inclusion of a string instrument section on certain songs . Clocking in at just over an hour in length , The Answer is Never is commonly regarded as Howards Alias ' best altogether album . The album artwork was provided by UK comic book artist , Chronic Fatigue . ",

    "text": "The ITS launch vehicle was a 2016 - 2017 design for a privately funded orbital launch vehicle planned to be developed by SpaceX. Design work was discontinued in 2017 when development was shifted to a smaller version , now called BFR . The initial design objective of the ITS launch vehicle was to launch a variety of SpaceX Interplanetary Transport System missions to Mars and other destinations in the beyond - Earth - orbit portion of the Solar System . The first launch was not expected before the 2020s . The ITS launch vehicle was to be operated as a somewhat unusual two - stage rocket . Its first stage was to have been powered by 42 Raptor rocket engines \u2014 designed and manufactured by SpaceX \u2014 operating on densified ( chilled near triple point ) methane / oxygen , propellants that have not been widely used as rocket propellants in the past . Like the Falcon 9 orbital launch vehicle that preceded it , the ITS launch vehicle 's first stage design was intended to be reusable , following a return to the launch site and vertical landing following each launch . When announced , it was also designed to have a new feature for SpaceX launch vehicles : full reusability of even the second - stage and orbital spacecraft as well . The large payload capacity of the launch vehicle placed it into the super - heavy lift class , with the ability to place into low Earth orbit in reusable configuration and in expendable mode . The second stage of the Earth launch vehicle was planned to have two versions , the Interplanetary spaceship for passengers and cargo and the ITS tanker to deliver propellants to Earth orbit . Both were to be powered by six vacuum - optimized Raptor rocket engines with three additional sea - level - nozzle Raptor engines for maneuvering . Thus , the element of the launch vehicle that was to provide second - stage acceleration to orbital velocity on all launches from Earth would also be used as an on - orbit spacecraft . The Interplanetary spaceship was planned as a very long - duration carrier of both passengers and space cargo to interplanetary destinations , and was to have served as both a descent and ascent vehicle at Mars . The high - level specifications for the vehicle were publicly announced in September 2016 , but by July 2017 , SpaceX had stated they would not build the -diameter vehicles as previously planned , but would instead build a \" still large \" but much smaller launch vehicle first . Subsequently , that was revealed to be the BFR in September 2017 , a vehicle intended to cost - effectively replace and supersede all existing SpaceX launch vehicles and passenger / cargo spacecraft .

    "text": "Solar Jetman : Hunt for the Golden Warpship is a multi - directional shooter video game developed by Zippo Games and Rare and published by Tradewest . It was released in North America on 14 October 1990 and in Europe on 26 September 1991 for the Nintendo Entertainment System . The game is the third instalment of the Jetman series and was later re - released by Nintendo for their NES - based PlayChoice-10 arcade system in the United States in 1990 . In the game , series protagonist Jetman must manoeuvre his small craft through caverns of various planets whilst searching for pieces of the Golden Warpship . The game is presented in a horizontal side - view environment and has ranging gravitational pulls for each planet , which subjects Jetman 's craft to various forms of inertia . Similar to its predecessors , Jetman must keep his craft topped up with fuel in order to progress through levels . The game was developed mostly by Mancunian developer Zippo Games under the name of Iota before being ordered to change the game into a Jetman title by Rare . Ports of the game for the ZX Spectrum , Commodore 64 and Atari ST were completed but not released due to poor sales of the NES version . The game received mostly positive reviews upon release , with critics praising the game 's presentation and graphics , however criticism was directed at the game 's difficulty . It was later included in Rare 's 2015 Xbox One retrospective compilation , Rare Replay . ",

    "text": "Vicente Genaro de Quesada ( 1782 Havana , Cuba \u2013 15 August 1836 Madrid ) was a Spanish military figure . He participated in the Battle of Burgos ( 1808 ) during the Peninsular War , leading the Royal Guard and Walloon Guard . Forming a rearguard for the shattered Spanish lines , these troops absorbed repeated charges by General Lasalle 's French cavalry without yielding any ground . He later fought in the First Carlist War on the Isabeline ( Liberal ) side , losing the Battle of Alsasua in April 1834 . After the Mutiny of La Granja in August 1836 , he tried to suppress demonstrations in Madrid in support of restoring the Constitution of 1812 . The next day , with the queen regent having acceded to the demands of the mutineers , he fled to the village of Hortaleza , but was captured and killed there by a crowd including members of the National Militia .

Built in the 1720s , the palace offers a mixture of rococo , Gustavian and Victorian styles . The interior design is regarded as one of Sweden 's finest . Tullgarn Palace is mainly associated with King Gustaf V and Queen Victoria , who spent their summers here at the end of the 19th century and beginning of the 20th century . However , the palace was originally built for Duke Fredrik Adolf in the 1770s . Since Tullgarn was a popular summer palace amongst Swedish royalty , the palace houses fine examples of interiors from different epochs and personal styles , such as the small drawing room , decorated in the 1790s , the breakfast room in southern German Renaissance style from the 1890s and Gustav V 's cigar room , which has remained largely untouched since his death in 1950 .

The company specalised in co - productions targeted at international markets , and enjoyed immediate success during the final year of the Weimar Republic . During the Nazi era the company 's Jewish owners came under increasing pressure from the government and their property was expropriated . They were forced into exile , while Cine - Allianz continued to produce films under the Nazi regime until its merger with UFA in 1942 . Rabinovitch went into exile in France where he set up a fresh production company also named Cine - Allianz which produced films such as I Was an Adventuress ( 1938 ) . The 1951 film The Lost One was partly financed by money received as post - war compensation for the loss of Cine - Allianz . ",

Its population was about 150 ( as of 2005 ) with ethnic Russians constituting a majority . The village is situated in the eponymous valley between the Greater Caucasus and Bzyb ranges . The river Bzyb and several of its tributaries flow near the village . The valley was inhabited by the Abazins tribe which was one of the last peoples of the Caucasus to be conquered by Russia . After their subjection in 1864 almost all of them escaped to Turkey ; many perished at the Black sea coast from hunger and malaria , during the transportation to Ottoman Empire . Pskhu was the only settlement in the Transcaucasia to be occupied by Wehrmacht during the Battle of the Caucasus of World War II in the autumn of 1942 . The small hydro - electric power station supplies the energy to the village . Pskhu also has an airport with grass - covered surface . There are no regular flights although it is still used occasionally by tourists and by the local inhabitants . Several dolmens and the ruins of the mediaeval fortress remained near Pskhu . The nearby Inal - kuba ( Pskhu - Nykha ) mountain ( 1290 m ) is one of the seven shrines of the Abkhaz people . ",

    "text": "Il Gobbo di Rialto or the Hunchback of the Rialto is a granite statue of a hunchback found opposite the Church of San Giacomo di Rialto at the end of the Rialto in Venice . Sculpted by Pietro da Sal\u00f2 in the 16th century , the statue takes the form of a crouching , naked hunchback supporting a small flight of steps . According to the writings of Stefano Magno it was unveiled on 16 November 1541 and was used as a podium for official proclamations : the statutes of Venice or the names of offenders would be proclaimed by an official standing on the block at the same time as they were read out at Pietra del Bando near Piazza San Marco . It was also used as the finishing point for a punishment for minor misdemeanours ; the guilty party would be stripped naked and made to run the gauntlet of citizens lining the streets from Piazza San Marco to the Rialto , saving themselves further humiliation by kissing the statue . By the 19th century , time had taken its toll on the statue and , in 1836 , it was restored with funds provided by the civic authorities . The block above the hunchback 's head now bears a Latin inscription with the date of the restoration . It is said to communicate with the Pasquino , one of the talking statues of Rome . From the early 16th century the Pasquino , a statue of a torso , was used as an agent for critical commentaries against the Pope and the authorities : satirical notes would be attached anonymously to the base of the statue purporting to come from the Pasquino himself . Other statues in Rome would be used to fulfill a similar purpose and establish a dialogue . In the 17th century the Pasquino exchanged correspondence with Il Gobbo concerning the Republic of Venice , Pope Paul V and the writings of Cardinals Baronio and Bellarmino . The characters of Launcelot Gobbo and his father , Old Gobbo , in William Shakespeare 's The Merchant of Venice may have been inspired by this traditional symbol of the Rialto . ",

    "text": "Anna Karenina ( ) is a novel by the Russian author Leo Tolstoy , first published in book form in 1878 . Many authors consider Anna Karenina the greatest work of literature ever written , and Tolstoy himself called it his first true novel . It was initially released in serial installments from 1873 to 1877 in the periodical The Russian Messenger . A complex novel in eight parts , with more than a dozen major characters , it is spread over more than 800 pages ( depending on the translation ) , typically contained in two volumes . It deals with themes of betrayal , faith , family , marriage , Imperial Russian society , desire , and rural vs. city life . The plot centers on an extramarital affair between Anna and dashing cavalry officer Count Alexei Kirillovich Vronsky that scandalizes the social circles of Saint Petersburg and forces the young lovers to flee for Italy in a futile search for happiness . Returning to Russia , their lives further unravel . A second major plot line follows Levin , a character loosely based on Tolstoy himself , who rejects glitzy city life and those same social circles for his rural farm , but struggles with both his love for Kitty , who has rejected him , and with his Christian faith . Trains are a recurring motif throughout the novel , which takes place against the backdrop of rapid transformations as a result of the liberal reforms initiated by Emperor Alexander II of Russia , with several major plot points taking place either on passenger trains or at stations in Saint Petersburg or elsewhere in Russia . The novel has been adapted into various media including opera , film , television , ballet , figure skating and radio drama . The first film adaptation was released in 1911 but has not survived . ",

The historic Sunol Water Temple is situated in the Sunol Valley . Historically steelhead have run as high as the Sunol Valley via Alameda Creek , and restoration plans are underway to restore such anadromous fish runs . These restoration plans by the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission include the planned modification of a Pacific Gas and Electric pipeline that has blocked fish migration in Alameda Creek . The Sunol Valley Rock Quarry is located within the Sunol Valley ; this facility has been used as the source for fill material in a considerable amount of the land development for neighboring communities . In the course of excavating this quarry for such fill , chemical analysis has been conducted to ascertain the safety of such soils . Resultant analyses have shown that the soil has environmentally safe characteristics as defined by low or non - detectable concentrations of 18 heavy metals and asbestos fibers . ",

Law in the Cayman Islands tends to be a combination of the very old and the very new . As a leading offshore financial centre , the Cayman Islands has extremely modern statutes dealing with company law , insolvency , banking law , trust law , insurance and other related matters . However , in other areas of law , such as family law , the laws of the Cayman Islands are based upon old English statutes which can cause some difficulty in modern times . Other areas of law , such as international law , are essentially regulated externally through the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in London by Order in Council . A large body of the laws of the Cayman Islands consists of the common law , which continually updates itself through judicial precedent in the Territory and in other common law countries . The Cayman Islands is a dependent territory of the United Kingdom . Although the local legislature and courts are independent from the United Kingdom , the British Government deals with all international relations on behalf of the Territory . The Cayman Islands does not have a separate vote at the United Nations . ",

His first band was called La Contesta and he organised it when he was 20 . He was awarded a Maracas d'or the first year the awards ran . In 1983 , Philippe Langlais invited him to compose a mix of classical and jazz with his orchestra , the resulting composition called Op\u00e9ra Triangulaire . He was a judo champion 1963 - 65 . Multiple albums fused Antillean rhythms with other music from around the world . Guedon was instrumental in exporting the new sound of 60s and 70s Latin -guaguanco , boogaloo , salsa , descarga - to France and the rest of Europe . When Guedon began placing his percussion instruments at the front of the stage in the style of his great influence Ray Barretto , French audience members found themselves shocked and intrigued . Soon enough , greats like El Conde and Pacheco were touring France . Were it not for Henri Guedon , Europe could have conceivably taken years to move forward from mambo and cha - cha - cha . ",

    "text": "Google Chrome ( commonly known simply as Chrome ) is a freeware web browser developed by Google LLC . It was first released on September 2 , 2008 for Microsoft Windows , and was later ported to Linux , macOS , iOS and Android . Google Chrome is also the main component of Chrome OS , where it serves as a platform for running web apps . Google releases the majority of Chrome 's source code as the Chromium open - source project ; however , Chrome itself is proprietary software . One component that is not open - source is the built - in Adobe Flash Player ( that Chrome has disabled by default since September 2016 ) . Chrome used the WebKit layout engine until version 27 . As of version 28 , all Chrome ports except the iOS port use Blink , a fork of the WebKit engine . , StatCounter estimates that Google Chrome has a 68 % worldwide usage share of web browsers as a desktop browser . It also has 61 % market share across all platforms combined , because it has over 50 % share on smartphones ; and thus Chrome is the most used browser in virtually all countries ( most exceptions in Africa ) . Its success has led to Google expanding the \" Chrome \" brand name on various other products such as Chrome OS , Chromecast , Chromebook , Chromebit , Chromebox and Chromebase . ",

He is also a professor of history at Jeonju University . He is a son of Prince Yi Kang , the fifth son of Emperor Gojong of Korea , and his thirteenth wife , Lady Hong Ch\u014fng - sun , a former telephone operator . Currently , Yi Seok resides in a building renovated for his use by the city of Jeonju , 243 kilometers south of Seoul . The city government hopes that Seok 's settlement on the grounds of its Hanok Village will spotlight the historic significance of the city and help it to attract tourists . As part of this arrangement , Seok gives lectures to Jeonju visitors about Korean history . He also frequently lectures elsewhere and is often called upon for ceremonial duties , despite his official status as a private citizen . Recently , Seok authored a book about the late Joseon Dynasty royal court family and has founded an organization , which he now leads , \" The Imperial Grandson Association \" , dedicated to preserving the culture of the royal court . The Republic of Korea owned website , Korea.net , recognizes King Yi Seok as the only remaining heir in Korea . ",

The obelisks in London and New York are a pair ; the one in Paris is also part of a pair originally from a different site in Luxor , where its twin remains . Although all three needles are genuine Ancient Egyptian obelisks , their shared nickname is a misnomer , as they have no connection with the Ptolemaic Queen Cleopatra VII of Egypt and were already over a thousand years old in her lifetime . The London and New York needles were originally made during the reign of the 18th Dynasty Pharaoh Thutmose III . The Paris needle dates to the reign of the 19th Dynasty Pharaoh Ramesses II , and was the first to be moved and re - erected . The New York needle was the first to acquire the French nickname , \" L'aiguille de Cl\u00e9op\u00e2tre \" , when it stood in Alexandria . ",

In the East Prussian plebiscite of 1920 , which was largely boycotted by ethnic Poles , the inhabitants voted to remain in Germany by a count of 198 - 0 . After World War II the region was placed under Polish administration by the Potsdam Agreement under territorial changes demanded by the Soviet Union . Most Germans fled or were expelled and replaced with Poles expelled from the Polish areas annexed by the Soviet Union or Ukrainians forced to settle in the area through Operation Vistula in 1947 . ",

He was a younger son of John of Luxembourg , Lord of Beauvoir and Marguerite of Enghien . Lewis was elected archbishop of Rouen in 1436 . He was the leading native administrator / collaborator with the Lancastrian regime in France . As its position weakened , his own fortunes and even personal safety became precarious . Although the city of Rouen did not fall to Charles VII of France until late 1449 , well after Luxembourg 's death , Henry VI 's government had long ago decided he needed and deserved remuneration and status based more securely in England . Thus he was provided to Ely ' in commendam ' on 27 September 1437 . This was the fifth wealthiest see in England , yet also amongst the smallest in terms of size or burden . He is not known ever to have visited it . He died on 18 September 1443 . ",

    "text": "Radu D. Lecca ( February 15 , 1890 \u2013 1980 ) was a Romanian spy , journalist , civil servant and convicted war criminal . A World War I veteran who served a prison term for espionage in France during the early 1930s , he was a noted supporter of antisemitic concepts and , after 1933 , an agent of influence for Nazi Germany . While becoming a double agent for Romania 's Special Intelligence Service ( SSI ) , Lecca was involved in fascist politics , gained in importance during World War II and the successive dictatorships , and eventually grew close to Conduc\u0103tor Ion Antonescu . After 1941 , Lecca was Commissioner , later Commissioner General , tasked with solving the \" Jewish Question \" in Romania , sharing Romania 's responsibility for the Holocaust . Advised by the special German envoys Manfred Freiherr von Killinger and Gustav Richter and acting with Antonescu 's consent , he established the Central Jewish Office ( Centrala Evreiasc\u0103 , CE ) through which he persecuted , exploited and extorted the Romanian Jewish community , whose existence was threatened by deportations into Transnistria . The system he supervised was notoriously corrupt , with many of the funds extorted being used for the personal benefit of Lecca or his political associates . Commissioner Lecca was also instrumental in negotiating the Final Solution 's application in Romania , a plan which was eventually abandoned , while considering mass emigration to Palestine in exchange for payments . After the August 1944 Coup removed Antonescu and aligned Romania with the Allies , Lecca was among the high - ranking Romanian politicians arrested and transported to the Soviet Union . Upon his 1946 return , Lecca was Antonescu 's co - defendant in a People 's Tribunal case , and was condemned to death . His sentence was commuted into life imprisonment and later reduced by the communist regime . After his release , Lecca wrote memoirs which make various controversial claims , and which minimize his and Antonescu 's participation in Holocaust - related crimes . ",

The AFL 's focus on Gaelic footballers is due to the similarities between the sports . The Irish Experiment began in the mid-1980s as an informal project of the Melbourne Football Club . Despite its initial success , enthusiasm for the project lapsed until the 2000s , when it again became ongoing and currently increasing due to globalisation and professionalism in sport . The highest profile product of the experiment to date has been Medal of the Order of Australia and Brownlow Medal recipient Jim Stynes , who was an early recruit . Irishman Tadhg Kennelly was a key player in the Sydney Swans 2005 AFL Grand Final victory . The highest profile Gaelic footballer to sign an AFL contract is Tommy Walsh . Over the years the Irish experiment has attracted media and public interest in both Ireland and Australia . ",

    "text": "Municipal elections in Canada fall within the jurisdiction of the various provinces and territories , who usually hold their municipal elections on the same date every two , three or four years , depending on the location . Each province has its own nomenclature for municipalities and some have local elections for unincorporated areas which are not technically municipalities . These entities can be called cities , towns , villages , townships , hamlets , parishes and , simply , municipalities , county municipalities , regional county municipalities , municipal districts , regional districts , counties , regional municipalities , specialized municipalities , district municipalities or rural municipalities . Many of these may be used by Statistics Canada as the basis for census divisions or census subdivisions . Municipal elections usually elect a mayor and city council and often also a school board . Some locations may also elect other bodies , such as Vancouver , which elects its own parks board . Some municipalities will also hold referenda or ballot initiatives at the same time , usually relating to spending projects or tax changes . Elections for city councils are held through either a ward system or at - large system , depending on the location . Vancouver is the largest city in Canada to use the at - large system , while most other larger cities use wards . Most councils are non - partisan and elect only independents . However , some municipalities have locally based political parties or election slates . These include Montreal , Quebec City and Longueuil in Quebec and Vancouver , Victoria , Surrey and Richmond in British Columbia . These local parties are rarely affiliated with any provincial or federal parties . Voting may be done with paper ballots that are hand - counted , or by various forms of electronic voting . ",

    "text": "The Great Belt Fixed link ( ) is a multi - element fixed link crossing the Great Belt strait between the Danish islands of Zealand and Funen . It consists of five structures : a road suspension bridge and a railway tunnel between Zealand and the small island Sprog\u00f8 located in the middle of the Great Belt , and a box girder bridge for both road and rail traffic between Sprog\u00f8 and Funen . The \" Great Belt Bridge \" ( Danish : Storeb\u00e6ltsbroen ) commonly refers to the suspension bridge , although it may also be used to mean the box - girder bridge or the link in its entirety . The suspension bridge , officially known as the East Bridge , has the world 's third longest main span ( 1.6 \u00a0 km ) , and the longest outside of Asia . It was designed by the Danish engineering firms COWI and Ramboll . The link replaced the ferry service that had been the primary means of crossing the Great Belt . After more than five decades of speculation and debate , the decision to construct the link was made in 1986 ; the original intent was to complete the railway link three years before opening the road connection , but the link opened to rail traffic in 1997 and road traffic in 1998 . At an estimated cost of DKK 21.4 billion ( 1988 prices ) , the link is the largest construction project in Danish history . The link has reduced travel times significantly ; previously taking about an hour by ferry , the Great Belt can now be crossed in about ten minutes . The construction of the link and the \u00d8resund Bridge ( constr . 1995 - 1999 ) have together enabled driving from mainland Europe to Sweden and the rest of Scandinavia through Denmark . Operation and maintenance are performed by A / S Storeb\u00e6lt under Sund & B\u00e6lt . Construction and maintenance are financed by tolls on vehicles and trains . Cyclists are not permitted to use the bridge , but cycles may be transported by train or bus . ",

    "text": "The state of Prussia had its origins in the separate lands of the Margraviate of Brandenburg and of the Duchy of Prussia . The Margraviate of Brandenburg developed from the medieval Northern March of the Holy Roman Empire , passing to the House of Hohenzollern in 1415 . The Duchy of Prussia originated in 1525 when Albert of Brandenburg - Ansbach , a member of a cadet branch of the Hohenzollerns , secularized the eastern lands of the Teutonic Knights as a Polish fief . Prince - elector John Sigismund , Elector of Brandenburg , inherited the Duchy of Prussia in 1618 , thus uniting Brandenburg and Prussia under one ruler in a personal union ; the Elector 's state became known as Brandenburg - Prussia . The Kingdom of Prussia formed when Elector Frederick III assumed the title of Frederick I , King in Prussia , on 18 January 1701 . Hohenzollern monarchical rule of Prussia ceased in 1918 after the fall of the German Empire in the aftermath of World War I ; the Kingdom becoming instead the Free State of Prussia . The Allied Control Council decreed the formal abolition of the state of Prussia in 1947 following World War II . ",

Kulakov served as Stavropol First Secretary from 1960 until 1964 , immediately following Nikita Khrushchev 's ouster . During his First Secretaryship in Stavropol , Kulakov met Mikhail Gorbachev ; Kulakov became Gorbachev 's mentor , and when he left his Stavropol First Secretaryship to enter national politics , Gorbachev took over his former office . Kulakov was elected to several important seats in the 1960s . In 1971 , he was elected to the Political Bureau ( Politburo ) . He became a leading figure of Soviet leadership , and impressed Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev to such an extent that Western commentators believed that Kulakov would become Brezhnev 's successor . This did not happen since Kulakov died in 1978 , four years before Brezhnev . ",

    "text": "Clandestine literature , also called \" underground literature \" , refers to a type of editorial and publishing process that involves self - publishing works , often in contradiction with the legal standards of a location . Clandestine literature is often an attempt to circumvent censorship , prosecution , or other suppression . In academic study , such literature may be referred to as heterodox publications ( as opposed to officially sanctioned , orthodox publishing ) . Examples of clandestine literature include the Samizdat literature of Soviet dissidents ; the Aljamiado literature of Al - Andalus Spain ; and the nushu writing of some upper - class women in Hunan , China , from around the 10th century to the 19th century . Clandestine publications were plentiful during the Enlightenment era in 18th - century France , circulating as pamphlets or manuscripts , usually containing texts that would have been considered highly blasphemous by the Ancien R\u00e9gime , or even straight out atheist . These clandestine manuscripts particularly flourished in the 1720s , and contained such controversial works as Treatise of the Three Impostors and the reverend Jean Mesliers Atheistic Testament . Both texts were later published in edited versions by Voltaire , but handwritten manuscript copies have been found in private libraries all over Europe . The clandestine literature of 18th century France also consisted of printed works produced in neighbouring Switzerland or the Netherlands and smuggled into France . These books were usually termed \" philosophical works \" , but varied greatly in content from pornography , utopian novels , political slander and actual philosophical works by radical enlightenment philosophers like Baron d'Holbach , Julien Offray de La Mettrie and Jean - Jacques Rousseau . The willingness to break the law may be due to ideological reasons , when works are contrary to government positions or pose a threat to the institutions in power , but also for reasons at a formal level , when publications do not comply with legal regulations imposed for the circulation of printed works . Underground literature is a type of clandestine literature that does not necessarily have the evasion of the censorship of the time as its purpose ; the goal of its writers may only be to lower publishing costs , often being funded by the authors themselves . Works that are originally published by clandestine means may eventually become established as canonical literature , such as Das Kapital and El Busc\u00f3n . A legitimate publisher in one jurisdiction may assist writers from elsewhere to circumvent their own laws by enabling them to publish abroad . The Olympia Press in Paris published several 20th - century English - language writers , including Henry Miller , who were facing censorship and possible prosecution in their own country at the time .

The vegetation is dominated by dense temperate forests , which give way to alpine meadows higher up under the rocky Andean peaks . A highly distinctive and emblematic feature is its alerce forest ; the globally threatened alerce tree is the second longest living tree species in the world ( > 3,600 years ) . The alerce forests in the park are in an excellent state of conservation .

Unlike the majority of the adapted characters in the film , Louie was not featured in Rudyard Kipling 's original works . King Louie was portrayed as an orangutan who was the leader of the other jungle primates , and who attempted to gain knowledge of fire from Mowgli , in order to become more human . King Louie was voiced by Louis Prima in the original 1967 film . Initially , the filmmakers considered Louis Armstrong for the role , but to avoid the likely controversy that would result from casting a black person to voice an ape , they instead chose Prima , a white singer . Christopher Walken voiced King Louie in the 2016 live - action / CGI The Jungle Book film . ",

According to Armenian historian Ghazar Parpetsi , who is the only source about the life of Zarir , the latter was a son of the Sasanian shah Yazdegerd II . He had several brothers named Balash , Hormizd III , and Peroz I. After the death of Peroz I ( who had succeeded his father as king ) , Balash was elected as king by the nobility and clergy . Zarir , dissatisfied with the election , rebelled . Balash was thus forced to make peace with his enemy Vahan Mamikonian and sent him at the head of an army to suppress the rebellion of Zarir . Zarir was shortly defeated , and fled to the mountains , but was quickly captured and \" shot down like an animal \" . ",

    "text": "Fingerpori is a Finnish comic strip written and drawn by Pertti Jarla . It started in Helsingin Sanomat in February 2007 , and is currently syndicated in Satakunnan Kansa , Aamulehti , Karjalainen , Keskisuomalainen , Turun Sanomat and Etel\u00e4 - Saimaa . Several strip collections in album format have also been published . The main setting of the strip is Fingerpori , an imaginary Finnish small town . The main character in the strip is the eyeglass - wearing Heimo Vesa , but other citizens also appear , such as the brash - mouthed caf\u00e9 worker Rivo - Riitta . As well as the Fingerpori residents , the strip has included characters such as the Pope , The Phantom , Spider - Man , Adolf Hitler , Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen and Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim . A few strips , featuring Jesus , have caused controversy in some circles . The humour in Fingerpori is largely verbal and is often based on ( mostly untranslatable ) wordplay and puns . For instance , Vesa works at the multidisciplinary research center Fingerpoli , where \" girls with pigtails \" is a result of a bungled stem cell experiment . Jokes are often also based on allusions , such as recurrent jokes about the skull ring of The Phantom . Besides this , the strips often have an absurdist element . According to Jarla , his original vision for Fingerpori was to create a milieu of an \" East German Duckburg \" , but the current Fingerpori is more like a Finnish town still stuck to the 1970s as in Aki Kaurism\u00e4ki 's films . Although Fingerpori contains some political satire , the author claims it is not a political comic strip . ",

The treasury was well aware of the difference in tax takes , and the incentive to convert ; the legal reforms of Bayezid II halved some criminal penalties on nonmuslim taxpayers \" so that the taxpayers shall not vanish \" ; this rule was reconfimed , a century later , in 1587 . In other cases , local taxes were imposed on nonmuslims specifically to encourage conversion . \u0130spen\u00e7e had existed in the Balkans before the Ottoman conquest ; the Ottoman Empire typically adapted local taxes and institutions in each conquered area , leading to a patchwork of different taxes and rates . The concept of \u0130spen\u00e7e , theoretically a payment in lieu of corvee labour , was derived from the Byzantine \" zeugaratikion \" , a land tax based on the zeugarion - the area of farmland which could be ploughed by a pair of oxen . The zeugarion itself was taken up as the Ottoman \" \u00e7ift \" , a word meaning \" pair \" . ",

    "text": "Scotch and Soda is a magic effect involving a copper coin and a silver coin which appear to transpose in the spectator 's hands . The effect relies on simple gimmick and tricks can be performed with it that are self - working , requiring almost no skill . The trick is named after the cocktail Scotch and soda ; the copper coin represents the \" Scotch \" and the silver coin represents the \" soda \" . The effect is usually performed as follows : The magician displays two coins of almost equal size , one copper and one silver . The silver coin is most often a U.S. half dollar and the copper coin is usually either an English penny or a Mexican centavo . The magician stacks the coins and places them into the spectator 's hand . He then asks her to place her hands behind her back and put one coin in each hand , remarking that the silver coin is slightly larger than the copper coin , making them easy to tell apart . The magician asks to see the silver coin which the spectator produces . When the spectator opens her other hand , the copper coin has become a quarter . The copper coin can then be made to appear wherever the magician desires , such as in the spectator 's pocket or under an object across the room . Scotch and Soda is a popular trick that can be purchased at magic stores . A number of books exclusively on the subject describe different effects that can be achieved with the Scotch and Soda gimmick . Gin and tonic is a version of the trick using a dime and a penny . Another more recent version is Captain & Coke 2.0 as released by the Blue Crown , it uses a US quarter and a US penny . The modern version that uses a 20 Centavo and a Kennedy half is often attributed to Richard Himber . In the early 1900s , America 's oldest magic company , Martinka made a version that utilized a Barber half dollar and a large cent . ",

    "text": "\" Ramblin ' on My Mind \" is a blues song recorded on November 23 , 1936 in San Antonio , Texas by blues musician Robert Johnson . The song was originally released on 78 rpm format as Vocalion 03519 and ARC 7 - 05 - 81 . Johnson performed the song in the key of E , and recorded two takes . Both takes were used for different pressings of both the Vocalion issue and the ARC issue . The song used the melody made popular by the hit record \" M & O Blues \" by Walter Davis . Johnson composed two songs to this melody , \" Ramblin ' on My Mind \" and \" When You Got a Good Friend \" , with different musical approaches and different guitar tunings , although both were in the key of E. For \" Ramblin ' on My Mind \" he used an open tuning that allowed him to combine a boogie shuffle on the bass strings with bottleneck triplets on the treble strings . These slide triplets were the model for Elmore James 's guitar accompaniment to \" Dust My Broom \" . The song was recorded by John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers with Eric Clapton on lead vocals and featured on the album Blues Breakers with Eric Clapton ( 1966 ) , and by Clapton on the albums Just One Night , , Sessions for Robert J , and on Live from Madison Square Garden . Lucinda Williams also recorded it for her first professional release , Ramblin ' ( 1979 ) . ",

Until the resignation of his predecessor , Peter Hans Kolvenbach , it was not the norm for a Jesuit Superior General to resign ; they , like the great majority of the Popes up until Benedict XVI , generally served until death . However , the Jesuit constitutions include provision for a resignation .

The monument is located at the Botum Park near the centre of Phnom Penh not far from the Royal Palace . It features heroic statues of Vietnamese and Cambodian soldiers in the \" Socialist realist \" style developed in the Soviet Union in the 1930s , together with images of a woman and baby representing Cambodian civilians . The monument is in a popular park in the middle of the city . The monument has occasionally become a political focal point . On August 30 , 1998 , during post - electoral protests , several people climbed onto the monument with hammers , poured gasoline on it and set it on fire . This damage was repaired two months later by the authorities . On July 29 , 2007 , a bomb exploded at the base of the monument , causing little damage . ",

    "text": "Georg Riedel ( born 8 January 1934 ) is a Swedish double bass player and composer . Riedel migrated to Sweden at the age of four and attended school in Stockholm , including the Adolf Fredrik 's Music School . The best known recording featuring Riedel is probably Jan Johansson 's Jazz p\u00e5 svenska ( \" Jazz in Swedish \" ) , a minimalist - jazz compilation of folk songs recorded in 1962\u20131963 , though Riedel has recorded with other leading Swedish musicians including trumpeter Jan Allan and Arne Domn\u00e9rus . Riedel 's profile as a composer derives almost exclusively from writing music for Astrid Lindgren movies , including the main theme from the Emil i L\u00f6nneberga ( \" Emil of Maple Hills \" ) movies . He also composed the music for several films by Arne Mattsson in the 1960s as well as for film adaptions of novels by Stig Dagerman . Riedel also played on Jazz at the Pawnshop in 1977 . ",

The first South African to appear in an NFL regular season game , Anderson played in the league for 23 seasons with six teams . He spent the majority of his career with the Pittsburgh Steelers , but is also known for his tenure with the Minnesota Vikings . As a member of the Vikings in 1998 , Anderson became the first NFL kicker to have a perfect regular season , successfully making every field goal and point after touchdown during regular season play . However , Anderson 's accomplishment was overshadowed by a missed field goal in that year 's against the Atlanta Falcons , which is regarded as a primary factor in the Vikings ' subsequent defeat . Anderson continued to play in the NFL for six more seasons before retiring . ",

Two selections are from Coltrane 's own 1957 Blue Train , and \" One for Four \" had been previously unissued . \" Trane 's Blues \" had been issued on the compilation High Step in 1975 , previously known as \" John Paul Jones \" and named after himself , the bass player Chambers , and the drummer Philly Joe Jones . Like Prestige Records before them , as Coltrane 's fame grew long after he had stopped recording for the label , Blue Note used varied recordings , often those where Coltrane had been merely a sideman , and reissued them as a new album with Coltrane 's name prominently displayed . In this case , the Big Four conglomerate EMI continued that earlier practice . ",

The film deals openly , and sometimes graphically , with zoophilia . It features both real and simulated animal killings and coprophagia , and has been labeled obscene by many sources , notably by the OFLC of Australia . The film was banned in Australia by the Australian Classification Board in the mid 1970s with two failed attempts , according to the Australian Classification Board . The film went before the Australian Classification Board on April 1 , 1977 , and was banned again for the third time . The ban status on the film in Australia has remained largely unchanged since then , due to in part that the film violates Australian obscenity laws . ",

    "text": "The history of Panama during World War II begins in 1939 . Due to the American - controlled Panama Canal cutting across the center of the country , Panama was of major strategic importance to the Allied war effort , as well as the most important strategic location in Latin America during World War II . It provided an invaluable link between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans that was vital to both commerce and the defense of the Western Hemisphere . Therefore , the defense of the Canal Zone was the United States ' chief concern in the American Theater . Panama never received Lend - Lease assistance , but in return for the rights to build military infrastructure within Panamanian territory , the United States undertook large - scale public works projects , which did much to modernize the country and boost the economy .

The complete text of the play is now lost , but its portions survive in form of quotations in the later works . The plot also survives in form of a Persian language story , which appears to be a adaptation of the play , and is included in the 11th century text Majmal - ut - Tawarikh . In the play , king Ramagupta decides to surrender his queen Dhruvadevi ( \" Devi \" ) to a Shaka enemy when besieged . Ramagupta 's younger brother Chandragupta enters the enemy camp disguised as the queen , and kills the enemy ruler . The rest of the story is not clear from the surviving passages , but based on other historical evidence , it appears that in the last part of the play , Chandragupta dethrones Ramagupta and marries Dhruvadevi .

    "text": "The SS Keno is a preserved historic sternwheel paddle steamer and National Historic Site of Canada . The SS Keno is berthed in a dry dock on the waterfront of the Yukon River in Dawson City , Yukon , Canada . The vessel was constructed in 1922 , in Whitehorse , by the British Yukon Navigation Company , a subsidiary of the White Pass and Yukon Route railway company . For most of its career it transported silver , zinc and lead ore down the Stewart River from mines in the Mayo district to the confluence of the Yukon and Stewart rivers at Stewart City . It was retired from commercial service in 1951 due to the extension and improvement of the Klondike Highway in the years after World War II . Following its withdrawal from service the SS Keno was laid up at the BYN Co. shipyard in Whitehorse , before being selected for preservation and donated by the company to the Canadian Government in 1959 . On 25 August 1960 the Keno left Whitehorse to sail downstream to Dawson City . In doing so she became the last of the Yukon 's sternwheeler steamers to navigate the Yukon River under her own power . Three days later she arrived in Dawson and was subsequently installed as a tourist attraction and a permanent memorial to the approximately 250 sternwheelers that provided a vital transport service on the Yukon River and its tributaries during the latter half of the 19th and first half of the 20th centuries .

He was director of ARPA 's Information Processing Techniques Office from 1965 through 1969 , founder and later manager of Xerox PARC 's Computer Science Laboratory from 1970 through 1983 , and founder and manager of Digital Equipment Corporation 's Systems Research Center until 1996 . Uniquely , Taylor had no formal academic training or research experience in computer science ; Severo Ornstein likened Taylor to a \" concert pianist without fingers , \" a perception reaffirmed by historian Leslie Berlin : \" Taylor could hear a faint melody in the distance , but he could not play it himself . He knew whether to move up or down the scale to approximate the sound , he could recognize when a note was wrong , but he needed someone else to make the music . \" His awards include the National Medal of Technology and Innovation and the Draper Prize . Taylor was known for his high - level vision : \" The Internet is not about technology ; it 's about communication . The Internet connects people who have shared interests , ideas and needs , regardless of geography . \" ",

With estimated sales of 100 million of albums worldwide , she and Selena Quintanilla are the most successful female Latin crossover artists ever . Although they had been recording since the mid-1970s , Estefan 's breakthrough came when Miami Sound Machine released the single \" Dr. Beat \" in Europe in 1984 . Though a major hit there , the band did n't make a commercial impact in the United States until the following year with the release of the single , \" Conga \" , which became a signature - song for Estefan . Both of the corresponding albums ( Eyes of Innocence and Primitive Love ) were credited to Miami Sound Machine . Their next album , 1987 's Let It Loose ( titled as Anything For You in Europe ) was credited to Gloria Estefan and Miami Sound Machine . All further albums after 1989 's Cuts Both Ways onwards were credited solely to Estefan herself , though Miami Sound Machine continues to be her backing band and perform with her live to the present day . Estefan has also recorded many albums in Spanish , and her 1993 album , Mi Tierra , is one of the most successful Spanish - language albums released in the USA . The album was also an international hit and became the first album in Spain to gain a Diamond certification ( for sales in excess of 1 million copies ) . ",

    "text": "The \" March of the Volunteers \" is the national anthem of the People 's Republic of China , including its special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau . Unlike most previous Chinese state anthems , it is written entirely in the vernacular , rather than in Classical Chinese . Its lyrics were composed as a dramatic poem by the poet and playwright , the Japan - educated Tian Han in 1934 and set to music by Nie Er from Yunnan Province the next year for the film Children of Troubled Times . It was adopted as the PRC 's provisional anthem in 1949 in place of the \" Three Principles of the People \" of the Republic of China and the Communist \" Internationale \" . When Tian Han was imprisoned during the Cultural Revolution in the 1960s , the march was briefly and unofficially replaced by \" The East Is Red \" , then played without words , then played with altered words . Restored to its original version , the \" March of the Volunteers \" was raised to official status in 1982 , adopted by Hong Kong and Macau upon their restorations to China in 1997 and 1999 , respectively , and included in the Chinese Constitution 's Article 136 in 2004 .

    "text": "Paul Ralph Ehrlich ( born May 29 , 1932 ) is an American biologist , best known for his warnings about the consequences of population growth and limited resources . He is the Bing Professor of Population Studies of the Department of Biology of Stanford University and president of Stanford 's Center for Conservation Biology . Ehrlich became well known for his controversial 1968 book The Population Bomb , which asserted that the world 's human population would soon increase to the point where mass starvation ensued . Among the solutions he suggested in that book was population control , to be used in his opinion if voluntary methods were to fail . Ehrlich has been criticized for his opinions ; for example , Ronald Bailey termed Ehrlich an \" irrepressible doomster \" . However , Carl Haub observed that Ehrlich 's warnings had encouraged governments to change their policies to avert disaster . Ehrlich has acknowledged that some of what he predicted has not occurred , but maintains that his predictions about disease and climate change were essentially correct , and that human overpopulation is a major problem .

In one of his last interviews he stated that he was saddened by the fact that The Godfather , a fiction he never liked , outshone the novel of his mother 's honest immigrant struggle for respectability in America and her courage and filial love , as portrayed in The Fortunate Pilgrim , 1965 . The Fortunate Pilgrim is the real birthplace of The Godfather . As Puzo says , the book 's hero , Lucia Santa , is based on his own mother : \" Whenever the Godfather opened his mouth , in my own mind I heard the voice of my mother . I heard her wisdom , her ruthlessness , and her unconquerable love for her family and for life itself . \u2026 The Don 's courage and loyalty came from her ; his humanity came from her \u2026 and so , I know now , without Lucia Santa , I could not have written The Godfather . \" ",

Roughly rhomboid , extending between and , the plate is wide and long . It is moving WSW at /year and the South Sandwich Plate is moving east at /year in an absolute reference frame . It takes its name from the steam yacht Scotia of the Scottish National Antarctic Expedition ( 1902 \u2013 04 ) , the expedition that made the first bathymetric study of the region . The Scotia Plate is made of oceanic crust and continental fragments now distributed around the Scotia Sea . Before the formation of the plate began ( 40Ma ) , these fragments formed a continuous landmass from Patagonia to the Antarctic Peninsula along an active subduction margin . At present the plate is almost completely submerged , with only the small exceptions of the South Georgia Islands on its northeastern edge and the southern tip of South America . ",

    "text": "Starin 's Glen Island was a summer resort in the community of New Rochelle in Westchester County , New York , developed by shipping magnate and U.S. Congressman John H. Starin in the late 1800s . Starin 's resort , referred to as \" America 's pleasure grounds \" and \" Disneyworld on the Sound \" , was the first theme park in the country . The park 's original design exhibited the five cultures of the western world on individual islands linked together with piers and causeways . The extreme popularity of the park resulted in a building boom in New Rochelle in the first decade of the twentieth century . The resort was located on Glen Island , in New Rochelle 's Lower Harbor , just off of Long Island Sound . The island is situated between Davids ' , Neptune , and Travers Islands in New Rochelle , and Hunter Island in nearby Pelham Bay Park , in the Bronx borough of New York City . Although now one island , the site originally consisted of one large main island in close proximity to at least four smaller nearby islands , a number of rocky outcroppings , low - lying flats , and salt marshes . The site is currently occupied by the county 's Glen Island Park , which includes remnants of some of the historic structures . ",

It has few inhabitants , almost all Swedish - speaking . Gransk\u00e4r belongs to the municipality of Vaasa . The area has been inhabited since before the time of Swedish dominion over Finland ; the first habitations can be traced to at least the 11th century and possibly earlier . Gransk\u00e4r is part of a larger archipelago and most of the smaller islands around Replot have traditionally been used as fishing camps . Today the buildings are generally used as summer cottages since maritime activities play a large part in the culture of the region . Fishing is nowadays mostly a recreational activity , but there are still a number of professional fishermen active in the archipelago . A large part of the Kvarken archipelago has been designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site . ",

    "text": "University is the 1995 album by the American alternative rock band Throwing Muses , released on Sire Records and Reprise Records in the USA , and on 4AD elsewhere . It features the single \" Bright Yellow Gun \" , the band 's first national hit . The album 's radio exposure led to feature articles in Rolling Stone and other major music magazines . The album was recorded in the fall of 1993 , right before lead Muse Kristin Hersh recorded her first solo album , Hips and Makers . 4AD founder and president Ivo Watts - Russell convinced Hersh to release the solo album first , in early 1994 . This led to this album being delayed until 1995 . Despite all the positive notices and exposure for the album , sales were disappointingly low , and the band was dropped from Sire 's roster , ending the Muses ' major label years . The band has continued sporadically ever since , releasing two more albums on the independent 4AD , one in 1996 and one in 2003 , before releasing 2013 's Purgatory / Paradise on their own label . ",

Although the smallest capital city in the continental Americas by population , Belmopan is the third - largest settlement in Belize , behind Belize City and San Ignacio . Founded as a planned community in 1970 , Belmopan is one of the newest national capital cities in the world . Since 2000 Belmopan has been one of two settlements in Belize to hold official city status , along with Belize City . Belmopan is located in Cayo District at an altitude of above sea level . Belmopan was constructed just to the east of the Belize River , inland from the former capital , the port of Belize City , after that city 's near destruction by Hurricane Hattie in 1961 . The government was moved to Belmopan in 1970 . Its National Assembly Building is designed to resemble a Pre - Columbian Maya temple . ",

    "text": "The War between Armenia and Iberia ( AD 51 ) is known chiefly through its description in Tacitus ' Annals . The war took place as a delicate balance of power between the Roman and Parthian empires was in place in the Caucasus . Rome was then ruled by Claudius , Parthia by Vologases I. Two Iberian brothers then ruled the Caucasian kingdoms , Pharasmanes I in Iberia , Mithridates in Armenia . They were both dependent on Roman support , which had installed Mithridates on the Armenian throne in 35 AD . However , 15 years later , trust between the brothers had deteriorated , which Tacitus blames on the intrigues of Pharasmanes ' son Rhadamistus . Fearing usurpation by Rhadamistus , his father convinced him to make war upon his uncle and claim the Armenian throne for himself . The Iberians invaded with a large army and surrounded Mithridates at the fortress of Gorneas ( Garni ) , which was garrisoned by the Romans under the command of Caelius Pollio , a prefect , and Casperius , a centurion . Rhadamistus was unable to take the fortress by assault or by siege . Pollio , swayed by bribery from Rhadamistus , betrayed Mithridates and induced the Roman soldiers to threaten the capitulation of the garrison . Under this threat , Mithridates left the fortress in order to make peace with Rhadamistus . Rhadamistus then executed Mithridates and his sons , despite a promise of non - violence , and became King of Armenia . Of this usurpation , Tacitus wrote \" Rhadamistus might retain his ill - gotten gains , as long as he was hated and infamous ; for this was more to Rome 's interest than for him to have succeeded with glory \" . However , faced with this upset of the regional balance and fearing that Armenia and Iberia would unite as a single powerful kingdom in the hands of Rhadamistus , Tiridates entered Armenia with Parthian support in 53 AD . After 2 years of war , the Armenian nobility revolted and replaced Rhadamistus with the Arsacid prince Tiridates . This was unacceptable to Rome , and started the Roman \u2013 Parthian War of 58\u201363 . ",

    "text": "Intelligent design ( ID ) is a pseudoscientific argument for the existence of God , presented by its proponents as \" an evidence - based scientific theory about life 's origins \" . Proponents claim that \" certain features of the universe and of living things are best explained by an intelligent cause , not an undirected process such as natural selection . \" ID is a form of creationism that lacks empirical support and offers no testable or tenable hypotheses , so it is not science . The leading proponents of ID are associated with the Discovery Institute , a fundamentalist Christian and politically conservative think tank based in the United States . Though the phrase \" intelligent design \" had featured previously in theological discussions of the design argument , the first publication of the term intelligent design in its present use as an alternative term for creationism was in Of Pandas and People , a 1989 creationist textbook intended for high school biology classes . The term was substituted into drafts of the book , directly replacing references to creation science and creationism , after the 1987 United States Supreme Court 's Edwards v. Aguillard decision , which barred the teaching of creation science in public schools on constitutional grounds . From the mid-1990s , the intelligent design movement ( IDM ) , supported by the Discovery Institute , advocated inclusion of intelligent design in public school biology curricula . This led to the 2005 Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District trial in which U.S. District Judge John E. Jones III found that intelligent design was not science , that it \" can not uncouple itself from its creationist , and thus religious , antecedents , \" and that the school district 's promotion of it therefore violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution . ID presents two main arguments against evolutionary explanations : irreducible complexity and specified complexity . These arguments assert that certain features ( biological and informational , respectively ) are too complex to be the result of natural processes . As a positive argument against evolution , ID proposes an analogy between natural systems and human artifacts , a version of the theological argument from design for the existence of God . ID proponents then conclude by analogy that the complex features , as defined by ID , are evidence of design . Detailed scientific examination has rebutted the claims that evolutionary explanations are inadequate , and this premise of intelligent design \u2014 that evidence against evolution constitutes evidence for design \u2014 is a false dichotomy . It is asserted that ID challenges the methodological naturalism inherent in modern science though proponents concede that they have yet to produce a scientific theory . ",

    "text": "The Prime Minister of Thailand is the head of government of the Kingdom of Thailand . The prime minister is also the chairman of the cabinet of Thailand and represents the government at home and the country abroad . The post of prime minister has existed since 1932 , after a bloodless revolution forced the absolutist King Prajadhipok to grant for the people of Siam their first constitution . Under the newly established constitutional monarchy , the first prime minister of Siam was Phraya Manopakorn Nititada . At first , the office was called the President of the People 's Committee , it was later changed to Prime Minister of Siam when the king deemed it too communistic . Constitutionally the prime minister is required to be a member of the lower house of the National Assembly ( the House of Representatives ) . He must also gain their approval through a resolution before an official appointment by the king can take place . As a result , the prime minister might succumb to a vote of no confidence and removal in the House . However , this has never happened up to date . Throughout the post 's existence it has mostly been occupied by military leaders from the Royal Thai Army , three holding the rank of field marshal and seven the rank of general . The post of prime minister is currently held by General Prayut Chan - o - cha , who was formally appointed to the office on 24 August 2014 . Previously he was the de facto head of government as leader of the National Council for Peace and Order , since the coup d'\u00e9tat on 22 May 2014 . Note : The list includes leaders of military juntas and acting prime ministers . However , they are not counted in the official list as provided by the Royal Thai Government ",

    "text": "The Rhodesian Bush War \u2014 also called the Second Chimurenga and the Zimbabwe War of Liberation \u2014 was a civil conflict from July 1964 to December 1979 in the unrecognised country of Rhodesia ( later Zimbabwe - Rhodesia ) . The conflict pitted three forces against one another : the Rhodesian government , led by Ian Smith ( later the Zimbabwe - Rhodesian government of Bishop Abel Muzorewa ) ; the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army , the military wing of Robert Mugabe 's Zimbabwe African National Union ; and the Zimbabwe People 's Revolutionary Army of Joshua Nkomo 's Zimbabwe African People 's Union . The war and its subsequent Internal Settlement , signed in 1978 by Smith and Muzorewa , led to the implementation of universal suffrage in June 1979 and the end of white minority rule in Rhodesia , which was renamed Zimbabwe Rhodesia under a black majority government . However , this new order failed to win international recognition and the war continued . Neither side achieved a military victory and a compromise was later reached . Negotiations between the government of Zimbabwe - Rhodesia , the UK Government and Mugabe and Nkomo 's united \" Patriotic Front \" took place at Lancaster House , London in December 1979 , and the Lancaster House Agreement was signed . The country returned temporarily to British control and new elections were held under British and Commonwealth supervision in March 1980 . ZANU won the election and Mugabe became the first Prime Minister of Zimbabwe on 18 April 1980 , when the country achieved internationally recognised independence . ",

The fishery is limited to five total fish taken each year , each over 36 inches and taken through the ice with fishing spears . 25 anglers are chosen by lottery each day and given a flag to raise when they have caught a fish . When five flags have been raised the season is closed for the year . Seasons have lasted as little as a few hours . ",

    "text": "Osaka Bay ( \u5927\u962a\u6e7e \u014csaka - wan ) is a bay in western Japan . As an eastern part of the Inland Sea , it is separated from the Pacific Ocean by the Kii Channel and from the neighbor western part of the Inland Sea by the Akashi Strait . Its western shore is formed by Awaji Island , and its northern and eastern shores are part of the Kansai metropolitan area . Major ports on Osaka Bay include Osaka , Kobe , Nishinomiya , Sakai , Amagasaki , and Hannan . A number of artificial islands have been created in Osaka Bay in past decades , including Kansai International Airport , Kobe Airport , Port Island , and Rokko Island . Several islands at the south end of Osaka Bay are part of the Seto Inland Sea National Park . Industries locate around Osaka Bay because there is a skilled and plentiful workforce , many port facilities , efficient linkages ( from small to medium to large firms ) . There are good transport links ( including the Shinkansen ) , room for expansion ( land reclaimed from the sea ) , and a large local market ( 9 million ) . In a recent economic change in Osaka Bay , older ' heavy ' industries such as Nippon Steel have declined , and ' new tech ' companies such as ICT have expanded . There has been a growth in the quaternary industries \u2014 research , development , and information . There has also been a development in the science parks and the building of new motorways ; this has meant the loss of the countryside . The Tempozan Ferris Wheel and Osaka Aquarium Kaiyukan are both located in the Tempozan Harbor Village area of Osaka . ",

He was also a professed member from the Oratory of Jesus and was the author of the proper for the Mass and Divine Office of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus Christ and the Blessed Virgin . Eudes was an ardent proponent of the Sacred Hearts and dedicated himself to its promotion and celebration ; the Masses he compiled for both Sacred Hearts were later said for the first time both in his lifetime . He preached missions across France including Paris and Versailles while becoming known as a popular evangelist as well as a sought - out confessor and preacher . Father Eudes was also a prolific writer and wrote on the Sacred Hearts while also condemning the Jansenists in favour of full support for the pope . Eudes was canonized as a saint in mid-1925 and there is a current push to have him named as a Doctor of the Church . ",

The music was written by the Lightning Seeds ' Ian Broudie , with comedians David Baddiel and Frank Skinner \u2014 presenters of football - themed comedy show Fantasy Football League \u2014 providing the lyrics .

It also regularly reappears in the UK singles chart around major football tournaments involving the England team . The song has been described as the de facto \" anthem \" of English football since 1996 . Its chorus , with the refrain \" It 's coming home \" , has become a popular chant for fans at England games in subsequent years . ",

His works include : El barberillo de Lavapi\u00e9s , Jugar con fuego , Pan y toros , Don Quijote , Los diamantes de la corona , and El Diablo en el poder . He was born and died in Madrid , appropriately , since the themes are characters of his operas are often distinctly Spanish and Madrilenian . Among the characters featured by Barbieri are bullfighters , manolos and manolas , and even ( in Pan y toros ) the famous Spanish painter , Francisco Goya . The character of much of Barbieri \u2019s work is farcical , utilizing mistaken identity and other devices to entertain the audience . His themes deal largely with the ins and outs of love , and the relations between the upper and lower classes in nineteenth - century Spain , but there is also a distinct political character to much of his work . The zarzuelas El barberillo de Lavapi\u00e9s and Pan y toros both contain plots to overthrow the government . In addition to his compositions , Barbieri was also an accomplished musician . He was the founder of La Espa\u00f1a Musical ( a society for the promotion of Spanish operetta ) and the Society for Orchestral Music . ",

In France , he collaborated with famous scientists Jean - Baptiste Lamarck ( 1744 \u2013 1829 ) and Heinrich Christian Friedrich Schumacher ( 1757 \u2013 1830 ) , a fellow Dane on a research trip in Paris during the 1780s . Hwass is remembered for amassing a large shell collection that included numerous rare specimens . Many European scientists used the collection as a reference work for their personal publications . Hwass 's best - known written work was the 1792 publication of Encyclopedie Methodique . Although his friend , Jean Guillaume Brugui\u00e8re ( 1750 \u2013 1798 ) , is often credited as author of the encyclopedia , the majority of the work was done by Hwass . ",

    "text": "Abbas Kiarostami ( ; 22 June 1940 \u2013 4 July 2016 ) was an Iranian film director , screenwriter , poet , photographer and film producer . An active film - maker from 1970 , Kiarostami had been involved in over forty films , including shorts and documentaries . Kiarostami attained critical acclaim for directing the Koker trilogy ( 1987 \u2013 94 ) , Close - Up ( 1990 ) , Taste of Cherry ( 1997 ) \u2013 which was awarded the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival that year \u2013 and The Wind Will Carry Us ( 1999 ) . In his later works , Certified Copy ( 2010 ) and Like Someone in Love ( 2012 ) , he filmed for the first time outside Iran : in Italy and Japan , respectively . Kiarostami had worked extensively as a screenwriter , film editor , art director and producer and had designed credit titles and publicity material . He was also a poet , photographer , painter , illustrator , and graphic designer . He was part of a generation of filmmakers in the Iranian New Wave , a Persian cinema movement that started in the late 1960s and includes pioneering directors such as Bahram Beyzai , Nasser Taghvai , Ali Hatami , Masoud Kimiai , Dariush Mehrjui , Sohrab Shahid - Saless and Parviz Kimiavi . These filmmakers share many common techniques including the use of poetic dialogue and allegorical storytelling dealing with political and philosophical issues . Kiarostami had a reputation for using child protagonists , for documentary - style narrative films , for stories that take place in rural villages , and for conversations that unfold inside cars , using stationary mounted cameras . He is also known for his use of Persian poetry in the dialogue , titles , and themes of his films . Kiarostami 's films contain a notable degree of ambiguity , an unusual mixture of simplicity and complexity , and often a mix of fictional and documentary elements . The concepts of change and continuity , in addition to the themes of life and death , play a major role in Kiarostami 's works . ",

He took office after the impeachment and removal from office of his predecessor Dilma Rousseff . He had been Vice President since 2011 and Acting President since 12 May 2016 , when Rousseff was suspended while she faced an impeachment trial . At the age of 75 , he is the oldest person to have taken the office . The Senate 's 61\u201320 vote , on 31 August 2016 , to remove Rousseff from office meant that Temer succeeded her to serve out the remainder of Rousseff 's second term , ending 31 December 2018 . In his first speech in office , Temer called for a government of \" national salvation \" and asked for the trust of the Brazilian people . He also signaled his intention to overhaul the pension system and labor laws , and to curb public spending . A 2017 poll showed that Temer 's administration had 7 % popular approval , with 76 % of respondents in favor of Temer 's resignation . Despite widespread protests , Temer has refused to step down .

    "text": "The genocide of indigenous peoples is the mass destruction of entire communities of indigenous peoples . Indigenous peoples are understood to be people whose historical and current territory has become occupied by colonial expansion , or the formation of a state by a dominant group such as a colonial power . While the concept of genocide was formulated by Raphael Lemkin in the mid-20th century , the earlier expansion of various European colonial powers such as the Spanish and British empires , and the subsequent establishment of colonies on indigenous territory , frequently involved acts of genocidal violence against indigenous groups in the Americas , Australia , Africa and Asia . According to Lemkin , colonization was in itself \" intrinsically genocidal \" . He saw this genocide as a two - stage process , the first being the destruction of the indigenous population 's way of life . In the second stage , the newcomers impose their way of life on the indigenous group . According to David Maybury - Lewis , imperial and colonial forms of genocide are enacted in two main ways , either through the deliberate clearing of territories of their original inhabitants in order to make them exploitable for purposes of resource extraction or colonial settlements , or through enlisting indigenous peoples as forced laborers in colonial or imperialist projects of resource extraction . The designation of specific events as genocidal is often controversial . Some scholars , among them Lemkin , have argued that cultural genocide , sometimes called ethnocide , should also be recognized . A people may continue to exist , but if they are prevented from perpetuating their group identity by prohibitions against cultural and religious practices that are the basis of that identity , this may also be considered a form of genocide . Examples include the treatment of Tibetans by the Chinese government and Native Americans by the US government . ",

    "text": "White Light Rock & Roll Review is Matthew Good 's second album as a solo artist , and was released on June 15 , 2004 . Though it was not as well - received as his previous solo effort , Avalanche , it quickly achieved Gold certification in Canada . Recording sessions for White Light Rock & Roll Review began less than a year after the release of Avalanche , making it the shortest time spent between records for Good . Having become disenchanted with the state of recorded music , Good became enamored with the techniques employed by classic artists like Led Zeppelin and The Who , who spent much of their careers perfecting their live shows and recording albums live off the floor . To this end , Good sought to write songs that could best be conveyed to live audiences . In fact , many of the record 's tracks ( including \" Little Terror \" , \" North American for Life \" , \" Blue Skies Over Bad Lands \" , \" It 's Been A While Since I Was Your Man \" , and \" Ex - Pats of the Blue Mountain Symphony Orchestra \" ) were written and performed live , well in advance of the album 's release .

    "text": "Independence Pass , originally known as Hunter Pass , is a high mountain pass in the Rocky Mountains of central Colorado in the United States . It is at elevation on the Continental Divide in the Sawatch Range . The pass is midway between Aspen and Twin Lakes , on the border between Pitkin and Lake counties . State Highway 82 traverses it , in the process reaching the highest elevation of a paved Colorado state highway on a through road . After Cottonwood Pass to the south , it is the second - highest pass with an improved road in the state , the fourth - highest paved road in the state and the highest paved crossing of the Continental Divide in the U.S. Because of the heavy snowfall at its elevation , it is closed in wintertime , isolating Aspen from direct access from the east during the ski season . When the pass is open in warmer weather , it is a popular destination . A scenic overlook near the pass allows visitors to take in the alpine tundra environment above treeline , and offers excellent views to the east of Mount Elbert , Colorado 's highest peak and the second - highest mountain in the contiguous United States . Rock climbers are drawn to nearby bouldering opportunities , and informal paths lead to nearby mountain summits of even higher elevation . Backcountry skiers make use of the slopes during the late spring and early summer . Since 2011 the pass has been on the route of the USA Pro Cycling Challenge . The pass was formed by glacial action and erosion in the region , and its first recorded sighting was by Zebulon Pike in 1806 . Ferdinand Hayden surveyed it in 1873 . As part of the Continental Divide , it was the limit of European settlement in the region at the time , with the land to the west reserved for the Ute people . Prospectors who defied governor Frederick Walker Pitkin 's order crossed the pass on July 4 , 1879 , giving it its current name and setting up a similarly named village ( now a ghost town ) to its west . A toll road built across the pass was abandoned and neglected after a railroad connection was made to Aspen . A new road replaced it in the 1920s ; portions of the old route can still be seen along the western approach . The Independence Pass Foundation , based in Aspen , works to repair damage to the pass 's environment caused by both roads since 1984 . ",

    "text": "The Berlin - Hohensch\u00f6nhausen Memorial ( ) is a museum and memorial located in Berlin 's north - eastern Lichtenberg district in the locality of Alt - Hohensch\u00f6nhausen , part of the former borough of Hohensch\u00f6nhausen . It was opened in 1994 on the site of the main political prison of the former East German Communist Ministry of State Security , the Stasi . Unlike many other government and military institutions in East Germany , Hohensch\u00f6nhausen prison was not stormed by demonstrators after the fall of the Berlin Wall , allowing prison authorities to destroy evidence of the prison 's functions and history . Because of this , today 's knowledge of the functioning of the prison comes mainly from eye - witness accounts and documents sourced from other East German institutions . The prison was depicted in the 2006 film The Lives of Others , and in 2017 TV series The Same Sky . It is a member organisation of the Platform of European Memory and Conscience . ",

It is classified as part of the Sino - Tibetan language family . Shanghainese , like other Wu variants , is mutually unintelligible with other varieties of Chinese , such as Mandarin . Shanghainese belongs to the Taihu Wu subgroup , and contains vocabulary and expressions from the entire Taihu Wu area of southern Jiangsu and northern Zhejiang . With nearly 14 million speakers , Shanghainese is also the largest single form of Wu Chinese . It serves as the lingua franca of the entire Yangtze River Delta region . Shanghainese is rich in vowels ( twelve of which are phonemic ) and in consonants . Like other Taihu Wu dialects , Shanghainese has voiced initials : neither Cantonese nor Mandarin has voiced initial stops or affricates . The Shanghainese tonal system is also significantly different from other Chinese varieties , sharing more similarities with the Japanese pitch accent , with two level tonal contrasts ( high and low ) , whereas Cantonese and Mandarin are typical of contour tonal languages .

    "text": "Booker Taliaferro Washington ( \u2013 November 14 , 1915 ) was an American educator , author , orator , and advisor to presidents of the United States . Between 1890 and 1915 , Washington was the dominant leader in the African - American community . Washington was from the last generation of black American leaders born into slavery and became the leading voice of the former slaves and their descendants . They were newly oppressed in the South by disenfranchisement and the Jim Crow discriminatory laws enacted in the post - Reconstruction Southern states in the late 19th and early 20th centuries . Washington was a key proponent of African - American businesses and one of the founders of the National Negro Business League . His base was the Tuskegee Institute , a historically black college in Alabama . As lynchings in the South reached a peak in 1895 , Washington gave a speech , known as the \" Atlanta compromise \" , which brought him national fame . He called for black progress through education and entrepreneurship , rather than trying to challenge directly the Jim Crow segregation and the disenfranchisement of black voters in the South . Washington mobilized a nationwide coalition of middle - class blacks , church leaders , and white philanthropists and politicians , with a long - term goal of building the community 's economic strength and pride by a focus on self - help and schooling . But , secretly , he also supported court challenges to segregation and restrictions on voter registration , passing on funds to the NAACP for this purpose . Black militants in the North , led by W. \u00a0 E. \u00a0 B. Du Bois , at first supported the Atlanta compromise but after 1909 , they set up the NAACP to work for political change . They tried with limited success to challenge Washington 's political machine for leadership in the black community but also built wider networks among white allies in the North . Decades after Washington 's death in 1915 , the civil rights movement of the 1950s took a more active and militant approach , which was also based on new grassroots organizations based in the South , such as CORE , SNCC and SCLC . Booker T. Washington mastered the nuances of the political arena in the late 19th century , which enabled him to manipulate the media , raise money , develop strategy , network , push , reward friends , and distribute funds , while punishing those who opposed his plans for uplifting blacks . His long - term goal was to end the disenfranchisement of the vast majority of African Americans , who then still lived in the South . ",

Shiba T\u014dsh\u014d - g\u016b is notable for its giant ginkgo tree , one of the biggest in Tokyo , with a height of 21.5 m and a trunk circumference of 6.5 m. It is believed that Tokugawa Iemitsu , the third Tokugawa sh\u014dgun , planted the tree himself , when the T\u014dsh\u014d - g\u016b shrine was rebuilt in 1641 . Although slightly damaged on the branches and the tip of the trunk , it was designated Natural Monument in 1956 . Another giant ginkgo tree of similar characteristics in Tokyo is located in the grounds of Oji Shrine . ",

    "text": "Mono is a free and open - source project to create an Ecma standard - compliant .NET Framework - compatible software framework , including a C # compiler and a Common Language Runtime . Originally by Ximian , it was later acquired by Novell , and is now being led by Xamarin , a subsidiary of Microsoft and the .NET Foundation . The stated purpose of Mono is not only to be able to run Microsoft .NET applications cross - platform , but also to bring better development tools to Linux developers . Mono can be run on many software systems including Android , most Linux distributions , BSD , macOS , Windows , Solaris , and even some game consoles such as PlayStation 3 , Wii , and Xbox 360 . The Mono project has been controversial within the open - source community , as it implements portions of .NET Framework that may be covered by Microsoft patents . Although standardized portions of .NET Framework are covered under Microsoft Open Specification Promise \u2014 a covenant stating that Microsoft will not assert its patents against implementations of its specifications under certain conditions \u2014 other portions are not , which led to concerns that the Mono project could become the target of patent infringement lawsuits . Following Microsoft 's open - sourcing of several core .NET technologies since 2014 and its acquisition of Xamarin in the beginning of 2016 , an updated patent promise has been issued for the Mono project ( ) . The logo of Mono is a stylized monkey 's face , mono being Spanish for monkey . ",

    "text": "Antioch on the Orontes (; ; also Syrian Antioch ) was an ancient Greek city on the eastern side of the Orontes River . Its ruins lie near the modern city of Antakya , Turkey , and lends the modern city its name . Antioch was founded near the end of the fourth century BC by Seleucus I Nicator , one of Alexander the Great 's generals . The city 's geographical , military , and economic location benefited its occupants , particularly such features as the spice trade , the Silk Road , and the Royal Road . It eventually rivaled Alexandria as the chief city of the Near East . It was also the main center of Hellenistic Judaism at the end of the Second Temple period . Most of the urban development of Antioch occurred during the Roman Empire , when the city was one of the most important in the eastern Mediterranean area of Rome 's dominions . Antioch was called \" the cradle of Christianity \" as a result of its longevity and the pivotal role that it played in the emergence of both Hellenistic Judaism and early Christianity . The Christian New Testament asserts that the name \" Christian \" first emerged in Antioch . It was one of the four cities of the Syrian tetrapolis , and its residents were known as Antiochenes . The city was a metropolis of half a million people during Augustan times , but it declined to relative insignificance during the Middle Ages because of warfare , repeated earthquakes , and a change in trade routes , which no longer passed through Antioch from the far east following the Mongol invasions and conquests .

From 1834 to 1891 , Gaines was at the center of a legal battle to recognize her legal status as the sole heir of her deceased father 's estate and recover valuable land in New Orleans . During its 57-year history in the courtroom , the Gaines cases appeared before the Supreme Court seventeen times and Louisiana state and federal court at least seventy times . The Gaines cases are notable not only because of their length and complexity but also due to the controversial image and perseverance of Myra Clark Gaines herself , particularly at a time when women were confined to a domestic , dutiful ideal of femininity .

    "text": "Christopher Franke ( born 6 April 1953 , Berlin ) is a German musician and composer . From 1971 to 1987 he was a member of the electronic group Tangerine Dream . Initially a drummer with The Agitation , later renamed Agitation Free , his primary focus eventually shifted to keyboards and synthesizers as the group moved away from its psychedelic rock origins . While he was not the first musician to use an analog sequencer , he was probably the first to turn it into a live performance instrument , thus laying the rhythmic foundation for classic Tangerine Dream pieces and indeed for the whole Berlin school sound . After his departure from the group , he founded the Sonic Images record label , a new - age music label called Earthtone and the Berlin Symphonic Film Orchestra , and produced a number of solo music works . After leaving Tangerine Dream , his only live concert was on 9 October 1991 at the Astoria Theatre in London . He performed on stage with Edgar Rothermich ( a.k.a . Richard E. Roth ) who is also his producer and engineer on all his solo projects and film music after 1990 . Franke moved to Los Angeles in 1991 to pursue film work . In 1995 he scored the AFI short Requiem . He may be best known for composing the music for the science fiction television series Babylon 5 , as well as the score of the anime movie Tenchi Muyo ! in Love and in 2005 the music for German musical Ludwig\u00b2 ( with Konstantin Wecker ) .

    "text": "Zevs ( born Christophe Aguirre Schwarz on 17 November 1977 in Saverne , France ) is a French street artist , best known for his trademark \" liquidation \" technique . He was an early and influential graffiti artist and active as a tagger in Paris in the 1990s . He is named after a regional train , Zeus , that almost ran him over one day he was down in the metro . Working with other French artists in the second half of the 1990s like Andr\u00e9 and Invader , Zevs has been among the prominent figures who pioneered the French street art scene . By the end of the 1990s he became known for his poetic drawings of shadows in Paris , shortly after the departure of Facundo Newbery from Paris . Later he ' bombed ' models on the billboards between the eyes . Though his interventions have been very popular , it has been discussed in France whether it is vandalism or art . In 2008 Zevs had his first major survey exhibition at the classical art museum the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek in Copenhagen , Denmark . His work , including selections of all of his major series to that point , was displayed alongside masterpieces in the museum 's permanent collections such as \u00c9douard Manet 's The Absinthe Drinker and Auguste Rodin 's The Thinker .

    "text": "Glandularia , common name mock vervain or mock verbena , is a genus of annual and perennial herbaceous flowering plants in the family Verbenaceae . They are native to the Americas . Glandularia species are closely related to the true vervains and sometimes still included with them in Verbena . Horizontal chloroplast transfer occurred at least twice and possibly three times between these genera , which are otherwise too distinct to warrant unification . The discovery of the signal in the chloroplast genome was announced in 2008 by researchers from the University of Washington . Somehow , chloroplasts from V. \u00a0 orcuttiana , swamp verbena ( V. \u00a0 hastata ) or a close relative of these had admixed into the G. \u00a0 bipinnatifida genome . Although hybridization runs rampant in the true and mock vervains \u2013 the ancestors of the well - known garden vervain are quite obscure \u2013 it does not seem to have been the cause of the cross - species gene transfer . In addition , the researchers discovered the signal of one more transfer event . This had introduced chloroplasts from an ancestral member of the Verbena lineage nowadays found in South America into Glandularia . Although all members of the present genus can be distinguished to have a chromosome count of five , the South American species are diploid , while polyploid hybrid Glandularia are very widespread from northern Central America northwards . The second genetic introgression must have occurred before the genus spread north , as species with the Verbena - like chloroplasts are found all over the Americas . Since the new chloroplast genes replaced the old ones , it may be that the possibly hybridogenic G. \u00a0 bipinnatifida actually underwent horizontal chloroplast transfer twice in its evolutionary history .

    "text": "In a Silent Way is a studio album by American jazz trumpeter , composer , and bandleader Miles Davis , released on July 30 , 1969 , on Columbia Records . Produced by Teo Macero , the album was recorded in one session date on February 18 , 1969 , at CBS 30th Street Studio in New York City . Incorporating elements of classical sonata form , Macero edited and arranged Davis 's recordings from the session to produce the album . Marking the beginning of his , In a Silent Way has been regarded by music writers as Davis 's first fusion recording , following a stylistic shift toward the genre in his previous records and live performances . Upon its release , the album was met by controversy among music critics , particularly those of jazz and rock music , who were divided in their reaction to its experimental musical structure and Davis 's electric approach . Since its initial reception , it has been regarded by fans and critics as one of Davis 's greatest and most influential works . In 2001 , Columbia Legacy and Sony Music released the three - disc box set The Complete In a Silent Way Sessions , which includes the original album , additional tracks , and the unedited recordings utilized for production purposes .

    "text": "Kiirunavaara ( Northern Sami : Gironv\u00e1rri , Me\u00e4nkieli : Kierunavaara ) is a mountain in Kiruna , Sweden that contains one of the largest and richest bodies of iron ore in the world . The presence of iron in the area was known already in the mid-17th century , but at this early time communication lines to this northerly region were quite insufficient to permit any major exploitation . Only with the construction of a railway , the Iron Ore Line and the ports of Narvik and Lule\u00e5 at the end of the 19th century did commercial mining become a realistic proposition . The Swedish mining company LKAB ( Luossavaara - Kiirunavaara Aktiebolag ) has been mining the mountain since the beginning of the 20th century . The mining area around Kiruna and Malmberget and the iron port and steelworks at Lule\u00e5 made Norrbotten County one of the first , and most prominent , regions of heavy industry in Sweden , and the wider region has remained at the forefront of mining and steel smelting and alloying technology .

    "text": "\" Lisa Mona Lisa \" was the Austrian entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 1988 , performed in German by Wilfried . The song was performed twelfth on the night , following Germany 's Maxi & Chris Garden with \" Lied f\u00fcr einen Freund \" and preceding Denmark 's Kirsten & S\u00f8ren with \" Ka ' du se hva ' jeg sa ' ? \" . At the close of voting , it had received no points , placing it last out of a field of 21 . The song is a ballad in which the singer likens the object of his affection to the Mona Lisa , in that she is very mysterious but nonetheless entrancing . The song was recorded in German , French and English . Due to the song 's poor performance , the English version was not released . It was succeeded as Austrian representative at the 1989 Contest by Thomas Forstner singing \" Nur ein Lied \" . ",

It was released as the second single from her self - titled fifth studio album by Sony Music Entertainment on August 23 , 2013 . The song was written by Lavigne , David Hodges , Chad Kroeger , Jacob Kasher Hindlin , Rickard B. G\u00f6ransson and Peter Svensson and was produced by Peter Svensson . \" Rock n Roll \" is an upbeat pop punk song , and lyrically it is a declaration of rebellion on which the singer puts up her \" middle finger to the sky \" to \" let 'em know that she 's still rock and roll , \" refusing to behave like an adult . The song received a critical praise from music critics , and was highlighted as one of the standout tracks on the album . \" Rock n Roll \" performed moderately on the charts , reaching number one in South Korea and Taiwan , and number five in Japan , respectively . The song failed to make impact elsewhere , peaking at number 37 in Canada and number 91 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart . The music video directed by Chris Marrs Piliero shows Lavigne in full combat mode , conspiring with Danica McKellar ( playing a character called Winnie Cooperre ) in an attempt to \" save rock and roll \" .

It was the only structure that remained intact when stores along 103rd Street in Watts were burned in the 1965 Watts Riots . Remaining untouched in the middle of the stretch of street that came to be known as \" Charcoal Alley \" , the station became a symbol of continuity , hope , and renewal for the Watts community .

He served as a member of the staff of the domestic affairs section of the Military Affairs Bureau 's War Affairs Section . Shiizaki was one of several members of that staff to participate in a coup ( the Ky\u016bj\u014d incident ) in the early morning of August 15 , 1945 , the day the Emperor would declare Japan 's surrender . The coup was organized primarily by Major Kenji Hatanaka , and though quite a number of men were involved in the plot at one point or another , Shiizaki was one of the few to be involved in the climactic action ; the rebels , with the help of the First Imperial Guard Division , seized the Imperial Palace , held Emperor Hirohito under , essentially , house arrest , and sought to destroy the phonographic recordings which had been made of the Emperor 's surrender speech . Sometime around seven o'clock on the morning of August 15 , the plot began to fall apart . General Shizuichi Tanaka , commander of the Eastern District Army , arrived at the Palace and harangued the conspirators on their duty to their country , and demanding that the dishonor brought by their treason could only be absolved through seppuku . Shiizaki , along with a number of others , committed ritual suicide that morning , on the grounds of the Imperial Palace . ",

    "text": "Breakout is an arcade game developed and published by Atari , Inc. , released on May 13 , 1976 . It was conceptualized by Nolan Bushnell and Steve Bristow , influenced by the 1972 Atari arcade game Pong , and built by Steve Wozniak aided by Steve Jobs . Breakout was the basis and inspiration for certain aspects of the Apple II personal computer . The game was ported to the Atari 2600 and was followed by a 1978 sequel , Super Breakout , which four years later became the pack - in game for the Atari 5200 console . Breakout spawned an entire genre of Breakout clones , and the concept found new legs with Taito 's 1986 Arkanoid which itself found dozens of imitators . In Breakout , a layer of bricks lines the top third of the screen . A ball travels across the screen , bouncing off the top and side walls of the screen . When a brick is hit , the ball bounces away and the brick is destroyed . The player loses a turn when the ball touches the bottom of the screen . To prevent this from happening , the player has a movable paddle to bounce the ball upward , keeping it in play . ",

    "text": "Operator Toll Dialing was a project and method used by the Bell System in the USA and Canada to automate the switching and billing of long distance calls in the public switched telephone network ( PSTN ) . The program was initiated by 1945 , at which time ca . 5 % of the 2.7 million toll board calls per day were handled by this method . Operator Toll Dialing eliminated the need for intermediate and inward operators to complete toll calls to distant central offices . Initially this system involved step - by - step routings to set up each circuit , but later was improved by the development of area codes with machine translation which helped to standardize dialing across the network . The system was implemented in the USA beginning in 1946 . In 1947 , the North American Numbering Plan for area codes was set up . Operator Toll DIaling was gradually superseded by Direct Distance Dialing ( DDD ) , in which the customer dialed the area code as well as the number . Beginning in 1951 on a limited basis , it was not fully implemented until the 1970s . Telephone administrations in other countries implemented similar programs , such as in the United Kingdom , which led to Subscriber Trunk Dialling ( STD ) . ",

    "text": "Mola di Bari , commonly referred to simply as Mola ( Barese : ) , is a town and comune of the Metropolitan City of Bari , in the region of Apulia , in Southern Italy , on the Adriatic Sea . In recent times , the town was best known for having primarily whitewashed buildings , however , growth , modern construction , and building design have changed the image significantly , particularly in the northern ( and more modern ) part of the town . Mola 's city center is its main piazza , Piazza XX Settembre near the port and it also boasts a church ( Chiesa Matrice , i.e. Mother Church ) dating back to the 13thcentury . Bakeries in Mola are known for their focaccia food . Until the early 1990s , there were two privately owned public firewood ovens available to the inhabitants of Mola , one located on Via Nino Bixio , on the southern part of the town , and the other located on Via Pesce , on the opposite side of the main Piazza . These businesses served the local residents by providing a place to cook baked goods , primarily focaccia and breads . Typically , focaccia pans were quite large ( some approaching half a meter in diameter ) and were difficult to cook in one \u2019s home . The tradition of sending items to be baked by the local oven has passed . Mola is also home to a large fishing industry that supplies fresh fish throughout the southern Italian region . ",

With regard to constructivism , Buchheister was typically more playful and improvisational than his contemporaries , becoming interested in the Dada movement after a collaboration with Kurt Schwitters in the late 1920s which led him to incorporate more varied materials such as acrylic glass , aluminum , wood , and twine into his compositions . This direction was given much freer rein after World War II and the end of Nazism . He died in Hanover in 1964 . ",

Until 2001 a Romanian Air Force military helicopters unit was located at the nearby airfield . In 2007 , as the airfield was not used by the Romanian Air Force anylonger , the former Minister of Transport Radu Berceanu suggested to use the location for Bucharest 's new low - cost flights airport(as the operational tariffs for Bucharest 's previous low - cost hub , Aurel Vlaicu Airport , were set to grow ) . However , some analysts considered the project unrealistic and doomed to fail due to the poor conditions of the infrastructure in the area . Eventually those plans were abandoned and all low - cost flights were moved in March 2012 at Bucharest main airport Henri Coand\u0103 International Airport . ",

It was created by MiST Land South ( renamed as GFI Russia in 2006 ) for Microsoft Windows and released in 2002 . It has several translation problems that make the game difficult to understand in English . The player starts as a character named \" Hacker \" who is just as the name implies . The player starts with a pistol and the ability to hack certain objects ( ATM 's , Trade Robots , etc . ) as well as a journal which gives maps of the area and tells them missions both current and completed . As certain missions are completed , the character 's level will increase and skills can have points added to them increasing areas like strength , aim , hacking skill , health points and so forth . The game offers the option to play solo or to join with other characters or groups ( such as the mob ) . Hacker is constantly hunted by the law making teaming up with someone in the best interest of the player 's survival . Teaming up will also add new missions to Hacker 's journal . Additional weapons , items , and body armor can be acquired by purchase or by killing another player . The character 's strength determines what weight of weapons , items etc . he can carry while certain clothing will increase or decrease the number of items they can carry . The heavier the weight , the less distance the character can move in a given turn . As strength and level increase , so will a character 's distance he can travel . The game never really gained much ground in terms of commercial success . ",

The stations make up seven radial passenger train lines , which all operate from Southern Cross station in Melbourne , Australia , with two further lines proposed to be reopened to V / Line passenger rail services . Stations listed in bold are terminus stations . Frequent services operate to the major regional cities of Ballarat , Bendigo , Geelong , Seymour , and the Latrobe Valley ; with a smaller number of services continuing to the end of their respective lines . Services to Ballarat , Bendigo , Geelong , and the Latrobe Valley were upgraded as part of the Regional Fast Rail project completed in 2006 . Four lines previously closed to passenger services - those to Ararat , Bairnsdale , Leongatha and Mildura were proposed to be refurbished as part of the Linking Victoria project . While all were expected to reopen during 2004 , only the Ararat and Bairnsdale lines have been reopened , with the Leongatha and Mildura projects delayed . ",

    "text": "Cesare Mori ( Pavia , December 22 , 1871 \u2013 Udine , July 6 , 1942 ) was a prefect ( prefetto ) before and during the Fascist period in Italy . He is known in Italy as the \" Iron Prefect \" ( Prefetto di Ferro ) because of his iron - fisted campaigns against the Mafia in Sicily in the second half of the 1920s . He is widely regarded as a fascist , even though at the beginning of Italy 's fascist dictatorship he arrested both fascists and socialists when he was prefect of Bologna . He officially joined the Fascist National Party only in 1926 . He was probably an officer who did n't have any strong political beliefs and who exhibited courage , dedication and integrity in the defense of the state and its institutions especially in combating the Mafia in Sicily . Nonetheless , the fight against the Mafia carried out by Cesare Mori proved to be effective mainly due to the special powers granted to him by Benito Mussolini when he was prefect in Sicily . Italian film director Pasquale Squitieri made a movie in 1977 --- Il prefetto di ferro --- about his fight against the Mafia when he was prefect in Sicily . ",

It runs clubs , bars , shops , supermarkets , launderettes , restaurants , caf\u00e9s and other facilities on most British military bases and also canteens on board Royal Navy ships . Commissioned officers are not usually supposed to use the NAAFI clubs and bars , since their messes provide these facilities and their entry , except on official business , is considered to be an intrusion into junior ranks ' private lives . NAAFI personnel serving aboard ship are part of the Naval Canteen Service ( NCS ) , wear naval uniform and have action stations , but remain ordinary civilians . NAAFI personnel can also join the Expeditionary Force Institutes ( EFI ) , which provides NAAFI facilities in war zones . EFI personnel are members of the Territorial Army serving on special engagements , bear ranks and wear uniform . NCS personnel can similarly volunteer to join the Royal Navy when it goes on active service . Petty Officer John Leake , NCS canteen manager in HMS Ardent , was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal ( DSM ) in the 1982 Falklands War for his courage while manning a machine gun . ",

Both sides signed it on December 24 , 1814 , in the city of Ghent , United Netherlands . The treaty restored relations between the two nations to status quo ante bellum , restoring the borders of the two countries to the lines before the war started in June 1812 . The treaty was approved by the UK parliament and signed into law by the Prince Regent ( the future King George IV ) on December 30 , 1814 . It took a month for news of the peace treaty to reach the United States , and in the meantime American forces under Andrew Jackson won the Battle of New Orleans on January 8 , 1815 . The Treaty of Ghent was not fully in effect until it was ratified by the U.S. Senate unanimously on February 17 , 1815 . It began two centuries and more of peaceful relations between the U.S. and Britain , although there were a few tense moments such as the Trent Affair in 1861 . ",

Sync Framework includes a transport - agnostic architecture , into which data store - specific synchronization providers , modelled on the ADO.NET data provider API , can be plugged in . Sync Framework can be used for offline access to data , by working against a cached set of data and submitting the changes to a master database in a batch , as well as to synchronize changes to a data source across all consumers ( publish / subscribe sync ) and peer - to - peer synchronization of multiple data sources . Sync Framework features built - in capabilities for conflict detection \u2013 whether data to be changed has already been updated \u2013 and can flag them for manual inspection or use defined policies to try to resolve the conflict . Sync Services includes an embedded SQL Server Compact database to store metadata about the synchronization relationships as well as about each sync attempt . The Sync Framework API is surfaced both in managed code , for use with .NET Framework applications , as well as unmanaged code , for use with COM applications . It was scheduled to ship with Visual Studio 2008 in late November 2007 . ",

    "text": "The Tule Lake camp was a federal work facility and WRA isolation center located in Siskiyou County , five miles west of Tulelake , California . It was established by the United States government in 1935 during the Great Depression for vocational training and work relief for young men , in a program known as the Civilian Conservation Corps . The camp was established initially for CCC enrollees to work on the Klamath Reclamation Project . During World War II , in 1942 the Tule Lake War Relocation Center was built next to the camp as one of ten concentration camps in the interior of the US for the incarceration of Japanese Americans who had been forcibly relocated from the West Coast , which was defined as an Exclusion Zone by the US military . Two - thirds of the 120,000 incarcerated individuals were United States citizens . Renamed the Tule Lake Isolation Center , this facility was adapted in the wartime years to shelter Japanese - American strikebreakers used against resisters at the main segregation camp , imprison Japanese - American dissidents , and house Italian and German prisoners of war ( POWs ) who were assigned to work as farm laborers in the region . After the war , on 25 April 1946 , the camp was transferred from the Army to the Fish and Wildlife Service , which had managed it just prior to the establishment of the segregation camp . The four remaining buildings are being restored in a project to return the camp to its 1940s appearance . ",

He was one of the seven founding saints of Brittany . Saint Malo of Aleth was baptized as an adult by Saint Brendan the Navigator . He became a student of Saint Brendan . As a monk at Llancarfan Abbey in Wales , Saint Malo was known for his participation in the famous Voyage of Saint Brendan . As an Immigrant to Brittany , he helped in the missionary work of Saint Aaron of Brittany , was the first bishop of Aleth ( modern Saint - Servan , France ) and established churches in the area of Brittany now named Saint - Malo in his honor . Saint Malo of Aleth was later driven from the area to Saintes , France by opponents of his mission . Details of Malo 's career have been preserved in three medieval ' Lives ' that seem to include incidents associated with multiple people bearing a similar name . It appears that Saint Malo of Aleth was probably born in Wales in approximately 520 . Malo 's name may derive from the Old Breton machlou , a compound of mach \" warrant , hostage \" and lou ( or loh ) \" brilliant , bright , beautiful \" . ",

In 2000 , the two leagues were officially disbanded as separate legal entities , and all of their rights and functions were consolidated in the commissioner 's office . Since that time , MLB has operated as a single league , and constitutes one of the major professional sports leagues of the United States . It is composed of 30 teams . The First - Year Player Draft , also known as the Rule 4 Draft , is MLB primary mechanism for assigning amateur baseball players from high schools , colleges , and other amateur baseball clubs to its teams . The first draft took place in 1965 ; it was introduced to prevent richer teams from negotiating wealthier contracts with top - level prospects and therefore , monopolizing the player market . Originally , three drafts were held each year . The first draft took place in June and involved high - school graduates and college seniors who had just finished their seasons . The second draft took place in January for high school and college players who had graduated in December . The third draft took place in August and was for players who participated in American amateur summer leagues . The August draft was eliminated after two years , and the January draft lasted until 1986 . The draft order is determined based on the previous season 's standings , with the team possessing the worst record receiving the first pick . In addition , teams that lost free agents in the previous off - season may be awarded \" compensatory \" picks . ",

    "text": "The Pittsburgh Catholic is the weekly Catholic newspaper for the Roman Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh , published for lay people and priests . It labels itself as the oldest Catholic newspaper in continuous publication . The newspaper was established in 1844 by Pittsburgh 's first bishop , Michael O'Connor . According to its website , the Catholic has a total market of 111,250 Catholics . The Catholic is available for free at most churches and Catholic outlets or centers in the Diocese of Pittsburgh , as churches purchase the newspaper in bulk for 21 cents per copy . Articles include news about events occurring throughout the diocese , articles on local diocesan schools , features on community and charity programs orchestrated by local Catholic organizations , reviews and commentary on contemporary media , question - and - answer forums by priests to explain church doctrine , and editorials on Church issues . The former Bishop of Pittsburgh , Donald Wuerl , was generally seen as a conservative bishop . As a result , the Pittsburgh Catholic is a conservative publication as well . However , because the newspaper is oriented towards the local region , it rarely contains extensive commentary on national issues . According to the Pittsburgh Business Times Book of Lists , the Pittsburgh Catholic is the largest weekly publication in western Pennsylvania and the second - largest newspaper in western Pennsylvania . The Pittsburgh Catholic is a member of the Catholic Press Association . Its general manager , Robert P. Lockwood , was nominated as finalist for the association 's annual St. Francis de Sales Award .

Aspren lived at the end of the 1st century and in the early 2nd century , as confirmed by archaeological studies regarding the early Neapolitan Church as well as the fact that \" Aspren \" was a common name during the days of the Roman Republic and the early years of the Roman Empire and afterwards fell into disuse . The Marble Calendar of Naples ( Calendario Marmoreo di Napoli ) attests to Aspren 's existence and the fact that he lived during the reigns of Trajan and Hadrian ; Aspren 's episcopate is stated as lasting twenty - three years . Nothing is known of his life , but an ancient legend holds that Saint Peter , on his way to Rome , stopped at Naples and converted an old woman ( identified as Candida the Elder ) after he cured her of an illness . Numerous other converts to Christianity were made during this time in Naples , including Aspren , who was converted either by Peter or Candida herself and who had also been ill . The legend holds that Peter consecrated Aspren as bishop of Naples and asked him to construct the oratory of Santa Maria del Principio , which would form the basis for the basilica of Santa Restituta ; San Pietro ad Aram was also said to have been built during this time .

Membership to the fraternity is open to honorable men studying at one of Freiburg 's universities and based exclusively on personality , good moral standing , and strength of character . Members of the Corps Hubertia value and engage in the tradition of academic fencing duels as a way to sharpen and prove their character under pressure . Continuing a practice dating back into the 1700s , Hubertia 's members wear the traditional Couleur , colored stripes , in green - gold - black . The fraternity teaches and expects tolerance from its members , stemming from diverse ethnic , national , religious and political backgrounds . Hubertia 's members are often referred to as Huberten . Members of the fraternity controlled the forestry departments of Baden , the south - west of Germany , in a de facto monopoly from the late 1800s to the early 20th century . Many of the members today practice this heritage as passionate hunters in private and fraternity events . ",

    "text": "In music , a fugue ( ) is a contrapuntal compositional technique in two or more voices , built on a subject ( a musical theme ) that is introduced at the beginning in imitation ( repetition at different pitches ) and which recurs frequently in the course of the composition . It is not to be confused with a fuguing tune , which is a style of song popularized by and mostly limited to early American ( i.e. shape note or \" Sacred Harp \" ) music and West Gallery music . A fugue usually has three main sections : an exposition , a development and a final entry that contains the return of the subject in the fugue 's tonic key . Some fugues have a recapitulation . In the Middle Ages , the term was widely used to denote any works in canonic style ; by the Renaissance , it had come to denote specifically imitative works . Since the 17th century , the term fugue has described what is commonly regarded as the most fully developed procedure of imitative counterpoint . Most fugues open with a short main theme , the subject , which then sounds successively in each voice ( after the first voice is finished stating the subject , a second voice repeats the subject at a different pitch , and other voices repeat in the same way ) ; when each voice has entered , the exposition is complete . This is often followed by a connecting passage , or episode , developed from previously heard material ; further \" entries \" of the subject then are heard in related keys . Episodes ( if applicable ) and entries are usually alternated until the \" final entry \" of the subject , by which point the music has returned to the opening key , or tonic , which is often followed by closing material , the coda . In this sense , a fugue is a style of composition , rather than a fixed structure . The form evolved during the 18th century from several earlier types of contrapuntal compositions , such as imitative ricercars , capriccios , canzonas , and fantasias . The famous fugue composer Johann Sebastian Bach ( 1685\u20131750 ) shaped his own works after those of Johann Jakob Froberger ( 1616 \u2013 1667 ) , Johann Pachelbel ( 1653 \u2013 1706 ) , Girolamo Frescobaldi ( 1583 \u2013 1643 ) , Dieterich Buxtehude ( c. 1637\u20131707 ) and others . With the decline of sophisticated styles at the end of the baroque period , the fugue 's central role waned , eventually giving way as sonata form and the symphony orchestra rose to a dominant position . Nevertheless , composers continued to write and study fugues for various purposes ; they appear in the works of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart ( 1756 \u2013 1791 ) and Ludwig van Beethoven ( 1770 \u2013 1827 ) , as well as modern composers such as Dmitri Shostakovich ( 1906 \u2013 1975 ) .

    "text": "The Horn Blows at Midnight ( 1945 ) is a comedy fantasy film directed by Raoul Walsh , and starring Jack Benny . Its biggest claim to fame , apart from its star , is its failure at the box office . In the two decades following its release , Benny often exploited the film 's failure for laughs in his popular radio and television comedy series The Jack Benny Program , making the film a well - known entity to his wide audience , even if they had never seen it . The Horn Blows At Midnight would prove to be Benny 's final starring feature , although he would continue as a radio and TV star ( as well as making cameo appearances in films ) for years afterwards . The Horn Blows At Midnight had the misfortune to be released only eight days after the death of U.S. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt . This may have contributed to its poor reception , although the film 's negative reviews ( often alluded in jokes mentioning the production ) might have also impacted it , as the classic Rodgers and Hammerstein musical Carousel , also dealing with the afterlife , opened on Broadway at roughly the same time and became a hit .

It is just wide at its narrowest point . It carries the main A970 road to Hillswick in the north west of Shetland and is about two miles west of the settlement of Brae . Mavis Grind is said to be the only place in the UK where you can toss a stone across land from the North Sea to the Atlantic Ocean . It is a regular crossing point for otters , which in Shetland are sea - dwelling . In 1999 , local volunteers successfully helped to demonstrate whether Viking ships could be carried across the isthmus , instead of sailing around the end of the island . Remains of a late Bronze Age settlement have been found close by . ",

At the time , many Australian TV series were only broadcast on a single station instead of being networked , which may have also been the case with the series . Cast included Rod McLennan , Judy Banks and Joff Ellen . There is very little information available on this show but it is known that the now - defunct Truth newspaper gave it an award for \" Best Children 's Show - Melbourne Television \" . Notably , it was produced by Crawford Productions . The title is possibly in reference to the sponsor . As was also the case with 1950s American television series , early Australian television series sometimes featured the name of the sponsor in the title . Other examples included The Dulux Show , Tarax Show , Shell Presents , Swallows Parade , The Astor Show , among others . There is no information available as to whether any episodes exist as kinescope recordings , the method used to record live television in Australia prior to the introduction of video - tape , as many live broadcasts of the era were not recorded .

    "text": "Between 2008 and 2011 , the Milton Friedman Institute for Research in Economics was an academic center established at the University of Chicago as a collaborative , cross - disciplinary site for research in economics . The Institute aimed to advance , refine , and share research that applied the tools of economic analysis to real - world issues . The institute was named in honor of former Chicago economics professor , Milton Friedman , who is widely recognized for his many enduring contributions to economic analysis . The institute was a collaboration of the University of Chicago Booth School of Business , Department of Economics , and Law School and fostered inquiry across a wide range of topics and subfields . The institute aimed to advance and preserve the unique University of Chicago economic tradition of combining theory and data in rigorous analysis -- an approach exemplified by Friedman and others . The Institute hosted visiting scholars working in subfields of economics , business , law , and related fields such as public policy and medicine . It hosted workshops , seminars , and lectures on fundamental questions across these fields . The Institute also supported advanced professional training for post - doctoral students , as well as expanded opportunities for University of Chicago graduate students . When announcing the creation of the institute in 2008 , University President Robert J. Zimmer said its goal was to create \" a primary intellectual destination for economics by creating a robust forum for engagement of our faculty and students with scholars and policymakers from around the world . \u201d The university had initially planned to invest $ 200 million in the institute , with half of that in the form of an operating endowment ; though the majority of funds were to be raised through donations . The institute was an object of intense controversy at the university , as many faculty objected both to its objectives as originally framed and to the naming of an institute after Friedman , who was viewed as polarizing . The announcement of the institute drew a response from more than 170 of the faculty at the university , who argued that to found such an institute would constitute \" a symbolic endorsement of his views by the University \" and that the proposal reflected \" a very narrow research scope even within the field of economics , not to speak of the complete disregard for other disciplines involved in the study of ' economy and society ' \" . In June 2011 , the institute and the Becker Center on Chicago Price Theory were joined to form the new Becker Friedman Institute for Research in Economics . ",

As Fingerprince was originally meant to be a three - sided album ( a concept abandoned due to expense and Monty Python 's Matching Tie and Handkerchief beating them to the punch ) , much of the material was abandoned and the third side remained unfinished until November 1977 although most tracks from the EP was shown at the Residents Radio Special in September 1977 . Thus , the group reduced the third side to an extended play record entitled ' \" Babyfingers ' \" , and released it in 1979 to people who had been waiting for their copy of The Third Reich and Roll box sets . A second printing was made for members of the W.E.I.R.D. fan club in 1981 , and a last pressing , on pink vinyl , in 1985 . It has been incorporated into most CD versions of Fingerprince , beginning in 1988 . ",

Excluded from the list are rivers such as the Dauphin , a short connecting link between lakes Manitoba and Winnipeg , with main stems of or less .

Five \u2014 the Milk , Pend d'Oreille , Saint Lawrence , Red , and Saint John \u2014 begin in the United States and flow into Canada . Of these , the Milk and the Kootenay cross the international border twice , the Milk leaving and then re - entering the United States , the Kootenay leaving and then re - entering Canada .

Sources report hydrological quantities with varied precision . Biologist and author Ruth Patrick , describing a table of high - discharge rivers , wrote that data on discharge , drainage area , and length varied widely among authors whose works she consulted . \" It seems , \" she said , \" that the wisest course is to regard data tables such as the present one as showing the general ranks of rivers , and not to place too much importance on minor ( 10\u201320 % ) differences in figures . \" ",

The final Stanhope ministry contained five ministers including Stanhope . With Stanhope resigning his ministerial posts , the cabinet was reduced to four ministers . The new ministry is also the first step in aligning ministerial appointments with the new structure of the ACT public service as recommended by the Hawke Review and adopted by the government . To this end , a number of ministerial appointments from the final Stanhope ministry have been consolidated or removed in the new appointments . Katy Gallagher has stated that , once the 2011 - 12 ACT Budget is passed by the assembly , she will appoint her deputy Andrew Barr to the Treasury portfolio in her place . ",

Her brother , having lost a singing contest to the storied V\u00e4in\u00e4m\u00f6inen , promised Aino 's \" hands and feet \" in marriage if V\u00e4in\u00e4m\u00f6inen would save him from drowning in the swamp into which Joukahainen had been thrown . Aino 's mother was pleased at the idea of marrying her daughter to such a famous and well born person , but Aino did not want to marry such an old man . Rather than submit to this fate , Aino drowned herself ( or ended up as a nix ) . However , she returned to taunt the grieving V\u00e4in\u00e4m\u00f6inen as a salmon . The name Aino , meaning \" the only one \" , was invented by Elias L\u00f6nnrot who composed the Kalevala . In the original poems she was mentioned as \" the only daughter \" ( aino tytti ) . ",

    "text": "Ripton is a fictitious town in Massachusetts , United States . Hugh Davis , brother of Hester A. Davis and a professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst , sought to demonstrate and protest the ignorance of the state bureaucracy in Boston of the rural portions of the commonwealth . To do so , he invented the town of Ripton . He then proceeded to apply for various grants and other official assistance , and the town was allotted funds in the state budget . Several checks were issued , and deposited in an escrow account , before the hoax was uncovered . The funds were returned and the matter dropped . In 1985 , Representatives of the town of Ripton contacted the US Air Force and invited them to situate antennas for a post - nuclear war communication system in their town . Robbins Phillips , chairman of the Board of Selectmen of Ripton , stated that the antennas would make good nesting places for eagles . As a protest of the issue today , some signposts in the western portion of Massachusetts still contain \" directions \" to Ripton . Lawmakers in western Massachusetts continued to humorously reference the incident in proposed state budgets . ",

Though not yet credited as a member of the band , future guitarist Greg Hetson , who was in Circle Jerks during this time , provided a guitar solo on \" Part III \" . How Could Hell Be Any Worse ? was also Bad Religion 's last album featuring Jay Bentley on bass for six years , until 1988 's Suffer .

Ireland was then as part of the United Kingdom from 1800 - 1922 and during this time in particular many Irishmen fought in the British Army . Different social classes joined the military for various reasons , including the Anglo - Irish officers who thoroughly identified with the British Empire , while others , typically poorer Irish Catholics did so to feed their families or seeking adventure . Many Irishmen and members of the Irish diaspora in Britain and also Ulster - Scots served in both World War I and World War II as part of the British forces . However , especially since the advent of Irish independence and The Troubles , the topic of enlistment in the British forces has been controversial for the Irish at home , but does still occur . Since partition , Irish citizens have continued to have the right to serve in the British Army . Since 2007 , when troops finally withdrew from the streets of Northern Ireland , the number of Irish citizens joining has increased , reaching its highest levels since World War II . ",

    "text": "Ferrous metallurgy is the metallurgy of iron and its alloys . It began far back in prehistory . The earliest surviving iron artifacts , from the 4th millennium BC in Egypt , were made from meteoritic iron - nickel . It is not known when or where the smelting of iron from ores began , but by the end of the 2nd millennium BC iron was being produced from iron ores from Sub - Saharan Africa to China . The use of wrought iron ( worked iron ) was known by the 1st millennium BC , and its spread marked the Iron Age . During the medieval period , means were found in Europe of producing wrought iron from cast iron ( in this context known as pig iron ) using finery forges . For all these processes , charcoal was required as fuel . Steel ( with a carbon content between pig iron and wrought iron ) was first produced in antiquity as an alloy . Its process of production , Wootz steel , was exported before the 4th century BC from India to ancient China , Africa , the Middle East and Europe . Archaeological evidence of cast iron appears in 5th - century BC China . New methods of producing it by carburizing bars of iron in the cementation process were devised in the 17th century . During the Industrial Revolution , new methods of producing bar iron by substituting coke for charcoal were devised and these were later applied to produce steel , creating a new era of greatly increased use of iron and steel that some contemporaries described as a new Iron Age . In the late 1850s , Henry Bessemer invented a new steelmaking process , that involved blowing air through molten pig iron to burn off carbon , and so to produce mild steel . This and other 19th - century and later steel making processes have displaced wrought iron . Today , wrought iron is no longer produced on a commercial scale , having been displaced by the functionally equivalent mild or low carbon steel . The largest and most modern underground iron ore mine in the world is located in Kiruna , Norrbotten County , Lapland . The mine which is owned by Luossavaara - Kiirunavaara AB , a large Swedish mining company , has an annual production capacity of over 26 million tonnes of iron ore . ",

    "text": "The Storming of the Winter Palace was a 1920 mass spectacle , based on historical events that took place in Petrograd during the 1917 October Revolution . Taking place on the third anniversary of the revolution , it was directed by Nikolai Evreinov and was subtitled a \" mass action . \" The sets were designed by Yuri Annenkov . The spectacle was staged outside the former Tsarist Winter Palace where the Provisional Government was meeting at the time of the Bolshevik revolution . Its performers included 125 ballet dancers , 100 circus people , 1,750 supernumeraries and students , 200 women , 260 secondary actors , and 150 assistants . There were also tanks and armoured cars involved . The mass spectacle form took the pre - revolutionary Symbolist utopias of \" ritual theatre \" ( whose formulation was largely a response to the abortive 1905 revolution ) , and recast their \" people \" as the proletariat . Performed on 7 November before 100,000 spectators , the action begins with the February Revolution , follows the gradual organization of the workers ( on a red stage to the left , with Kerensky and the Provisional Government on a white stage to the right ) , until they are illuminated fully by searchlights , and crying \" Lenin , Lenin \" charge over the arch which joins the two stages to do battle with the \" Whites . \" Kerensky leaps to a car for an escape , and is pursued along a path between the two large groups of spectators by trucks full of the Red Guard waving bayonets , to the Palace . Silhouettes struggle in the windows of the Palace , until the Red Army is finally successful , and red lights flash out . A cannon fired from the cruiser Aurora and fireworks herald the victory of the October Revolution . ",

Hindu traditions claim he ruled the entire region of Kashmir , Indus River and Hindu Kush as frontier lands of India known as Hindu Kush Kshetra and founded the city of Kashmir in the valley and Kasur with Lavapuri of lava in base lands , though local lore contends Kasur was founded in 1525 by Pashtun migrants . His brother Lava is traditionally believed to have founded Lavapuri ( current day city of Lahore ) .

    "text": "In the southwestern United States , a ramada is a temporary or permanent shelter equipped with a roof but no walls , or only partially enclosed . Ramadas have traditionally been constructed with branches or bushes by aboriginal Americans living in the region ( deriving from the Spanish rama , meaning \" branch \" ) . However , the term today is also applied to permanent concrete , wooden , or steel structures used to shelter objects or people from the sun . For example , public parks in desert areas of the United States may contain ramadas with picnic tables , restrooms , water sources , etc . Since sunlight is more of an environmental hazard than wind or snow or rain in this part of the world , a roof alone provides substantial shelter . And because there are no walls in the structure , airflow is unrestricted , helping to keep the temperature below the roof substantially cooler than ambient . An example of a large modern - day ramada can be seen at the Casa Grande Ruins National Monument in Arizona , where it is used to protect ancient ruins . ",

    "text": "\" Something to Believe In \" is a power ballad by American Glam metal band Poison , being the 2nd single from their 1990 album Flesh & Blood . \" Something to Believe In \" was also released on the Best of Ballads & Blues album in 2003 , with alternate lyrics ( part 2 ) . The song peaked at number 4 in the US Billboard Hot 100 , number 5 on the Mainstream rock charts , number 35 in the UK and # 44 on the Australian charts . It was the last Top 10 on Billboard chart for the band to date . This song was dedicated to James Kimo Maano , a security guard and best friend of Bret Michaels who had died some time earlier . The cover art for the single depicts a tattoo on Michaels ' arm of a cross with the words \" Something to Believe In \" . The tattoo artist , according to Michaels , had been drinking and spelled \" believe \" incorrectly putting the \" e \" before the \" i \" . It was attempted to be corrected by adding a rose to the cross that covered the misspelling , but Michaels was never satisfied with the results . In the first season of the reality show Rock of Love , Michaels goes to a tattoo shop where the tattoo artist properly touches up the tattoo . ",

    "text": "\" Bombtrack \" is a song by American rap metal band Rage Against the Machine that opens their self - titled debut album . Like most of Rage Against the Machine 's songs , the song 's lyrics discuss social inequality , proclaiming that \" landlords and power whores \" were going to \" burn \" . The riffs were composed by Rage Against the Machine bassist Tim Commerford . The song is one of three on the album in the key of F along with \" Know Your Enemy \" and \" Fistful of Steel \" . Impressed by their song , Rage Against the Machine named it Bombtrack in reference to hip hop terminology where the word ' bomb ' means ' the greatest ' , making the song title literally mean ' the greatest track ' . A music video was released , depicting support for the Peruvian Maoist terrorist organization , Sendero Luminoso and its leader Abimael Guzman . The video clip did not appear on the group 's first home video , citing Rage 's first altered political opinion . In 2003 , the video finally appeared as bonus material on their Live at the Grand Olympic Auditorium DVD . The single artwork features Cuban photographer Alberto Korda 's famous image of Che Guevara , Guerrillero Heroico . A mirrored version of the iconic two - tone portrait by Irish artist Jim Fitzpatrick ( T - shirt version ) . Perhaps the song 's most notable appearance outside of the music industry would be its appearance in Oliver Stone 's controversial film Natural Born Killers , when Mickey breaks out of his prison cell in search of Mallory .

    "text": "The Neue Bachgesellschaft , or New Bach Society , is an organisation based in Leipzig , Germany , devoted to the music of the composer Johann Sebastian Bach . It was founded in 1900 as the successor to the Bach Gesellschaft , which between 1850 and 1900 produced a complete edition of Bach 's works , publishing many pieces for the first time . On completion of these collected works ( the Bach - Ausgabe ) , the original Society dissolved itself . The new Society approved three enduring projects : the annual edition of a Bach - Jahrbuch ( Bach yearbook ) biannual ( today : annual ) Bachfeste ( Bach festivals ) . The venues of the Bachfest have mainly been in Germany , but the 2012 Festival had an international dimension , being held in G\u00f6rlitz - Zgorzelec on the German - Polish border . the founding of a Bach museum . In 1907 the Society opened the first museum dedicated to Bach at Eisenach , the town where he was born . This Bachhaus is managed by the Bachhaus Eisenach gemeinn\u00fctzige GmbH , a registered charitable company , with the New Bach Society as its sole associate . The Society has not been directly involved in publishing scores in the way that its predecessor was . However , in 1950 it recommended that the second complete edition of Bach 's music be undertaken , the Neue Bach - Ausgabe ( NBA , in English : New Bach Edition ) . The project was a joint venture of musicologists in G\u00f6ttingen , then West Germany , and Leipzig , then East Germany , in order to stress that the common cultural heritage was undivisible . ",

Educated at Upper Canada College , the University of Toronto , Boyd began his career in 1860 when he was articled to David Breakenridge Read . Later , his decision in Regina v. St. Catharines Milling and Lumber Company was to have a long - lasting influence on the interpretation of First Nations land claims in Canada . Boyd was Chancellor of the High Court of Justice of the Province of Ontario . He was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George ( KCMG ) during the visit to Canada of TRH the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and York ( later King George V and Queen Mary ) in October 1901 . In 1903 , Boyd and William Glenholme Falconbridge were appointed to a Royal Commission to investigate charges of bribery brought forward by Robert Roswell Gamey against the Liberal Government of the time . Although the commission found no proof for these allegations , the provincial Conservatives won the general election that followed two years later . ",

    "text": "The Piton des Neiges ( Snow Peak ) is a massive 3,069 \u00a0 m ( 10,069 \u00a0 ft ) shield volcano on R\u00e9union , one of the French volcanic islands in the Mascarene Archipelago in the southwestern Indian Ocean . It is located about east of Madagascar . Piton des Neiges is the highest point on R\u00e9union and is considered to be the highest point in the Indian Ocean . The volcano was formed by the R\u00e9union hotspot and emerged from the sea about two million years ago . Now deeply eroded , the volcano has been inactive for 20,000 \u00a0 years and is surrounded by three massive crater valleys , the Cirques . Piton des Neiges forms the northwestern two thirds of R\u00e9union , with the very active Piton de la Fournaise comprising the rest . As it name suggests , snow is occasionally seen on its summit in winter . The volcanic island is considered to be about three million years old ( Pliocene ) ; the other two islands in the archipelago , Mauritius and Rodrigues , are 7.8 \u00a0 million ( Miocene ) and 1 million ( Pleistocene ) years old , respectively . The island possesses a high endemism of flowering plants ( about 225 ) ; this has justified the creation of a biological reserve on the lower slopes of the Piton des Neiges . ",

The film is set in the city of K\u014dchi , on the Japanese island of Shikoku . It concerns a love triangle that develops between two good friends and a new girl who transfers to their high school from Tokyo .

In December 2016 , GKIDS announced that the film would be remastered for a limited theatrical release , beginning on December 28 , 2016 , with a home video release in Spring 2017 . ",

The Charter stated the ideal goals of the war : no territorial aggrandizement ; no territorial changes made against the wishes of the people ( self - determination ) ; restoration of self - government to those deprived of it ; reduction of trade restrictions ; global cooperation to secure better economic and social conditions for all ; freedom from fear and want ; freedom of the seas ; and abandonment of the use of force , as well as disarmament of aggressor nations . Adherents of the Atlantic Charter signed the Declaration by United Nations on 1 January 1942 , which became the basis for the modern United Nations . The Atlantic Charter set goals for the postwar world and inspired many of the international agreements that followed the war . The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ( GATT ) , the postwar independence of European colonies , and much more are derived from the Atlantic Charter . ",

    "text": "Load is the sixth studio album by the American heavy metal band Metallica , released on June 4 , 1996 by Elektra Records in the United States and by Vertigo Records internationally . The album showed more of a hard rock side of Metallica than the band 's typical thrash metal style , which alienated much of the band 's fanbase . It also featured influences from genres such as Southern rock , blues rock , country rock and alternative rock . Drummer Lars Ulrich said about Load more exploratory nature , \" This album and what we 're doing with it \u2013 that , to me , is what Metallica are all about : exploring different things . The minute you stop exploring , then just sit down and fucking die \" . At 79 minutes , it is Metallica 's longest studio album . Load debuted and spent four consecutive weeks at number one on the US Billboard 200 chart . Load sold 680,000 units in its first week , making it the biggest opening week for Metallica as well as the biggest debut of 1996 . It was certified 5\u00d7 platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) for shipping five million copies in the United States . Four singles\u2014\"Until It Sleeps \" , \" Hero of the Day \" , \" Mama Said \" , and \" King Nothing \"\u2014 were released as part of the marketing campaign for the album . ",

Beginning with the 1989 revolution , the legally recognized churches , especially the Romanian Orthodox Church , the country \u2019s largest religious group , pressured the post - communist authorities to introduce religious education in public schools , offer substantial financial support for theological institutions and allow denominations to resume their social role by posting clergy in hospitals , elderly care homes and prisons . Although education was an area where churches registered success in the early stages of post - communist transition , religious education remains a low priority in Romania . ",

And much like those songs , replaced sacred lyrics with secular blues lyrics with doo - wop call and response harmonies . The song was the B - side to Charles ' number - one R&B ; single , \" A Fool for You \" , and was a charted hit on its own , peaking at number nine on the chart . The tune was re - made to top 40 pop status in 1958 by The Everly Brothers . It should not be confused with the 1981 Gary U.S. Bonds hit \" This Little Girl . \" ",

    "text": "The \u00c5lg\u00e5rd Line ( ) is a closed , but not abandoned , railway line between Ganddal and \u00c5lg\u00e5rd in Rogaland , Norway . The line was built as a narrow gauge branch line of the J\u00e6ren Line by the Norwegian State Railways ( NSB ) and opened in 1924 . It runs through the villages of Foss - Eikeland and Figgjo in Sandnes to \u00c5lg\u00e5rd in Gjesdal . Several proposals were made for the \u00c5lg\u00e5rd Line to become the first part of the main line from Stavanger to Oslo , but instead the S\u00f8rlandet Line was connected to the J\u00e6ren Line in 1944 . At the same time , the \u00c5lg\u00e5rd Line was upgraded to standard gauge . The line had up to ten daily round trips with diesel multiple units , until passenger traffic was terminated in 1955 . Freight traffic remained until 1988 , when most of the line was abandoned in 1988 , although was used until 2001 . The line is owned by the Norwegian National Rail Administration . The station at Figgjo has been converted to a museum , and the section from there to \u00c5lg\u00e5rd is used for recreational draisines . There have been proposals to reopen the line either as part of the J\u00e6ren Commuter Rail or the planned light rail for Greater Stavanger . ",

    "text": "The Blue River is a tributary of the Colorado River , approximately long , in the U.S. state of Colorado . It rises in southern Summit County , on the western side of the continental divide in the Ten Mile Range , near Quandary Peak . It flows north past Blue River and Breckenridge , then through the Dillon Reservoir near Dillon . The West portal for the \" Roberts Tunnel \" is at the base of Dillon Reservoir . The Roberts Tunnel is a trans - basin diversion , built by Denver Water in 1962 , that diverts water under the Continental Divide from the Colorado River basin into the South Plate River Basin . The East portal is approximately one mile upstream of Grants , Colorado . North of Dillon the river flows NNW along the eastern slope of the Gore Range and joins the Colorado River at Kremmling . The Green Mountain Dam , upstream from Kremmling , forms the Green Mountain Reservoir , providing hydroelectric power and diversionary water for irrigation , as part of the Colorado - Big Thompson Project . The dam is a project of the United States Bureau of Reclamation . ",

During the American Civil War he served as a Confederate general , and his Tredegar Iron Company was a major source of munitions and ordnance for the Confederate States Army . Starting with a small forge and rolling mill in the mid-1830s , It was a flourishing operation by 1843 when he leased it . He eventually bought the company outright in 1848 and forcefully and aggressively built Tredegar Iron Works into the South 's largest and most significant iron works . When the Civil War broke out he entered the Army as a Brigadier General in 1861 . Shortly after he was wounded and then resigned from the Army returning to the iron works . It was the Confederacy 's major ( and for much of the war only ) source of cannons and munitions , employing some 900 workers , most of whom were slaves . His plant was confiscated by the Union army at the end of the war , but returned to him in 1867 and he remained president until his death . Anderson was very active in local civic and political affairs . ",

    "text": "\" The Archbishop \" is the third episode of the first series of the BBC sitcom Blackadder ( The Black Adder ) . It is set in England in the late 15th century , and follows the exploits of the fictitious Prince Edmund as he is invested as Archbishop of Canterbury amid a Machiavellian plot by the King to acquire lands from the Catholic Church . Most of the humour in the episode relies on religious satire . The script pays tribute to the real - life 12th century Archbishop of Canterbury , Thomas Becket . Edmund , faced with the threat of assassination , attempts to escape to France into self - imposed exile ; and in a later scene , two drunk knights overhear King Richard IV exclaiming \" Who will rid me of this turbulent priest ? \" , the words attributed to King Henry II which led to Becket 's death in 1170 , and embark on a mission to murder Edmund . \" The Archbishop \" won an International Emmy Award in 1983 in the Popular Arts category . The Catholic Church was to be satirized again in the second series , Blackadder II , in the 1986 episode \" Money \" . ",

    "text": "The Enterprise Objects Framework , or more commonly simply EOF , was introduced by NeXT in 1994 as a pioneering object - relational mapping product for its NeXTSTEP and OpenStep development platforms . EOF abstracts the process of interacting with a relational database by mapping database rows to Java or Objective - C objects . This largely relieves developers from writing low - level SQL code . EOF enjoyed some niche success in the mid-1990s among financial institutions who were attracted to the rapid application development advantages of NeXT 's object - oriented platform . Since Apple Inc 's merger with NeXT in 1996 , EOF has evolved into a fully integrated part of WebObjects , an application server also originally from NeXT . Many of the core concepts of EOF re - emerged as part of Core Data , which further abstracts the underlying data formats to allow it to be based on non - SQL stores . ",

It took place on the 26th day of the 4th month of the Keich\u014d era . As the Sh\u014dgun 's Eastern Army prepared to renew , the siege begun the previous winter , the \u014csaka garrison sallied forth , ambushing Tokugawa forces in a number of skirmishes and sieges . In the battle of Kashii , a contingent of forces loyal to Toyotomi Hideyori , lord of \u014csaka , attempted to besiege Wakayama Castle , which was controlled by Asano Nagaakira , an ally of the sh\u014dgun . The attackers were led by \u014cno Harunaga , Hanawa Naoyuki , and Okabe Noritsuna . Asano 's garrison realized that their attackers were far from support or reinforcements , and met them in battle at Kashii , a short distance from Wakayama . Okabe and Hanawa were killed in the battle , and \u014cno was therefore forced to retreat back to \u014csaka . ",

In the popular belief the Romans wore amulets usually as a talisman , to protect themselves against evil forces , demons and sorcery , but especially against the evil eye . In Plautus ' play , Epidicus asks the young girl Telestis : \" Do n't you remember my bringing you a gold lunula on your birthday , and a little gold ring for your finger ? \" An explicit definition is provided by Isidore of Seville : \" Lunulae are female ornaments in the likeness of the moon , little hanging gold bullae . \" But in Plautus ' play Rudens , Palaestra says her father gave her a golden bulla on the day of her birth . There is also some indication that babies of both sexes wore phallic amulets . ",

He is revered as being an ideal example of non - attachment to material possessions . As a king , he had access to luxuries and pleasures far beyond the ordinary , but his internal state was closer to that of a sadhu . He was intensely interested in spiritual discourse and considered himself free from worldly illusions . His interactions with sages and seekers such as Ashtavakra and Sulabha are recorded in ancient texts . His relationship with adopted daughter Sita led her to be called Janaki Mata . The Nepalese city of Janakpur is named for him and daughter Sita . The Videha ( or Mithila ) kingdom was located between east of Gandaki River , west of Mahananda River , north of Ganga river and south of Himalayas . The region is now divided between the present day Indian state of Bihar and a small part of Terai Region in Nepal . ",

    "text": "Ulysses is a modernist novel by Irish writer James Joyce . It was first serialised in parts in the American journal The Little Review from March 1918 to December 1920 and then published in its entirety in Paris by Sylvia Beach on 2 February 1922 , Joyce 's 40th birthday . It is considered to be one of the most important works of modernist literature and has been called \" a demonstration and summation of the entire movement \" . According to Declan Kiberd , \" Before Joyce , no writer of fiction had so foregrounded the process of thinking \" . Ulysses chronicles the peripatetic appointments and encounters of Leopold Bloom in Dublin in the course of an ordinary day , 16 June 1904 . Ulysses is the Latinised name of Odysseus , the hero of Homer 's epic poem the Odyssey , and the novel establishes a series of parallels between the poem and the novel , with structural correspondences between the characters and experiences of Leopold Bloom and Odysseus , Molly Bloom and Penelope , and Stephen Dedalus and Telemachus , in addition to events and themes of the early 20th - century context of modernism , Dublin , and Ireland 's relationship to Britain . The novel is highly allusive and also imitates the styles of different periods of English literature . Since its publication , the book has attracted controversy and scrutiny , ranging from an obscenity trial in the United States in 1921 , to protracted textual \" Joyce Wars \" . The novel 's stream - of - consciousness technique , careful structuring , and experimental prose \u2014 replete with puns , parodies , and allusions \u2014 as well as its rich characterisation and broad humour , have led it to be regarded as one of the greatest literary works in history ; Joyce fans worldwide now celebrate 16 June as Bloomsday .

    "text": "Lieutenant - General Arthur Ernest Percival , ( 26 December 1887 \u2013 31 January 1966 ) was a senior British Army officer . He saw service in the First World War and built a successful military career during the interwar period but is most noted for his defeat in the Second World War , when he commanded British Commonwealth forces during the Japanese Malayan Campaign and the subsequent Battle of Singapore . Percival 's surrender to the invading Imperial Japanese Army force , the largest surrender in British military history , undermined Britain 's prestige as an imperial power in East Asia . His defenders , such as Sir John Smyth , have argued that under - funding of Malaya 's defences and the inexperienced , under - equipped nature of the Commonwealth army , not Percival 's leadership , were ultimately to blame .

    "text": "Henry Wager Halleck ( January 16 , 1815 \u2013 January 9 , 1872 ) was a United States Army officer , scholar , and lawyer . A noted expert in military studies , he was known by a nickname that became derogatory : \" Old Brains . \" He was an important participant in the admission of California as a state and became a successful lawyer and land developer . Halleck served as General - in - Chief of all Union armies during the American Civil War . Early in the Civil War , Halleck was a senior Union Army commander in the Western Theater . He commanded operations in the Western Theater from 1861 until 1862 , during which time , while the Union armies in the east were defeated and held back , the troops under Halleck 's command won many important victories . However , Halleck was not present at the battles , and his subordinates earned most of the recognition . The only operation in which Halleck exercised field command was the Siege of Corinth in the spring of 1862 , a Union victory which he conducted with extreme caution . Halleck also developed rivalries with many of his subordinate generals , such as Ulysses S. Grant and Don Carlos Buell . In July 1862 , following Major General George B. McClellan 's failed Peninsula Campaign in the Eastern Theater , Halleck was promoted to general - in - chief of all U.S. armies . Halleck served in this capacity for about a year and a half . Halleck was a cautious general who believed strongly in thorough preparations for battle and in the value of defensive fortifications over quick , aggressive action . He was a master of administration , logistics , and the politics necessary at the top of the military hierarchy , but exerted little effective control over field operations from his post in Washington , D.C. His subordinates frequently criticized him and at times ignored his instructions . President Abraham Lincoln once described him as \" little more than a first rate clerk . \" In March 1864 , Grant was promoted to general - in - chief , and Halleck was relegated to chief - of - staff . Without the pressure of having to control the movements of the armies , Halleck performed capably in this task , ensuring that the Union armies were well - equipped . ",

Nowadays , his name is commonly written Legros , while he himself always signed as Le Gros ; he is frequently referred to either as ' the Younger ' or ' Pierre II ' to distinguish him from his father , Pierre Le Gros the Elder , who was also a sculptor . The \" ardent drama \" of his work and its Italian location make him more an Italian , than a French , sculptor . Despite being virtually unknown to the general public today , he was the pre - eminent sculptor in Rome for nearly two decades , until he was finally superseded at the end of his life by the more classicizing Camillo Rusconi .

    "text": "The Upper Ammonoosuc River is a tributary of the Connecticut River that flows through Co\u00f6s County in northern part of the northeastern U.S. state of New Hampshire . Despite its name , the river is not an upstream portion of the Ammonoosuc River , but instead a separate tributary of the Connecticut River flowing from to the north of the Ammonoosuc . The Upper Ammonoosuc rises in Pond of Safety in the town of Randolph , runs first generally north through rural portions of Berlin ( where it flows through the Godfrey Dam ) , Milan and a corner of Dummer , then west through Stark and then Northumberland where it drains into the Connecticut near the village of Groveton . The end points of that course are approximately 25 air miles ( 38 km ) apart . From Milan to Groveton it is fairly closely paralleled by New Hampshire Route 110 . Fort Wentworth was built in 1755 at the junction of the Upper Ammonoosuc and the Connecticut Rivers ( now near the village of Groveton ) . The fort was used sporadically during both the French and Indian War and the American Revolutionary War . The watershed area includes the northern Crescent Range , eastern Pliny Range and the eastern and northern Pilot Range , all in the White Mountains . Major tributaries of the Upper Ammonoosuc include : ",

    "text": "Souvlaki ( Greek : ) , plural souvlakia , is a popular Greek fast food consisting of small pieces of meat and sometimes vegetables grilled on a skewer . It is usually eaten straight off the skewer while still hot . It can be served with pita bread , fried potatoes , lemon , and sauces , but the souvlaki itself is eaten on its own , with the side dishes eaten subsequently . The meat usually used in Greece and Cyprus is pork , although chicken , beef , and lamb may also be used . In other countries ( and for tourists ) , souvlaki may be made with meats such as lamb , beef , chicken , and sometimes fish . The word souvlaki is a diminutive of the Medieval Greek \u03c3\u03bf\u03cd\u03b2\u03bb\u03b1 souvla ' skewer ' , itself borrowed from Latin subula . ' Souvlaki ' is the common term in Hellenic Macedonia and other regions of northern Greece , while in southern Greece around Athens it is commonly known as ' kalamaki ' , ' reed ' . ",

    "text": "\" Amambanda \" was the Dutch entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 2006 , performed predominantly in an imaginary language but with some words in English by Treble . This was the second occasion on which a song had been performed with lyrics in an invented language - Belgium having entered Sanomi by Urban Trad at the 2003 Contest . The song is an up - tempo number , with many influences from African and flamenco music . The lyrics explain that \" There is a way / To understand without a language \" , in keeping with the musical theme of exuberant joy in spite of an apparently insurmountable language barrier . The title was the cause of much confusion prior to the Contest , with the official CD of entries titling the track \" Amanbanda \" ( with an \" n \" instead of an \" m \" ) . BBC commentary referred to the song as \" Amamdangda \" briefly , as well as describing the group as \" a mother and her two daughters \" , which was also incorrect as Caroline Hoffman was not the mother of the two van Dijk sisters , though this comment was sarcastic and not taken as literal by listeners . As the Netherlands had not finished the 2005 Contest in the top 10 , the song was performed in the semi - final . Here , it was performed seventeenth , following Finland 's Lordi with \" Hard Rock Hallelujah \" and preceding Lithuania 's LT United with \" We Are The Winners \" . At the close of voting , it had received 22 points , placing 20th in a field of 23 and thus missing out on the final and requiring the Netherlands to qualify from the semi - final at the next Contest . Immediately following this result , rumours began to circulate that the Netherlands would opt out of the next Contest . These rumours were , however , proven to be untrue as the country began qualification for the 2007 Contest . It was succeeded as Dutch representative at the 2007 Contest by Edsilia Rombley with \" On Top of the World \" . ",

It surmounts Ramorino Glacier to the north , upper Crosswell Glacier to the northeast , Goodge Col to the southeast , and Branscomb Glacier to the south - southwest . The peak was discovered on IGY reconnaissance flights in January 1958 , and named by the Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names ( US - ACAN ) for Lieutenant Commander Conrad S. ( Gus ) Shinn , U.S. Navy , a pilot on some of these flights . Shinn was pilot of the Navy R4D aircraft carrying Admiral Dufek which , on October 31 , 1956 , made the first plane landing at the geographic South Pole . It had been thought to be over 4800 m high , but was re - measured in 2001 by Damien Gildea and Rodrigo Fica of the Omega Foundation , using a Trimble 5700 GPS receiver and the Australian government 's AUSPOS processing system .

    "text": "In Sunni Islam , an imam khatib ( or just imam , ) is a leader , often the leader of prayers in the masjid , and the Muslim community . This compound title is merely a common combination of two elementary offices : leader ( imam ) of the congregational prayer , which in larger mosques is performed at the times of all daily prayers ; and preacher ( khatib ) of the sermon or khutba at the required congregational prayer on Friday . Although either duty can be performed by anyone who is regarded as qualified by the congregation , at most well - established mosques imam khatib is a permanent ( part - time or full - time ) position . He may be elected by the local community , or appointed by an outside authority \u2014 e . g. , the national government , or the waqf which sustains the mosque . There is no ordination as such ; the only requirement for appointment as an imam khatib is recognition as someone of sufficient learning and virtue to perform both duties on a regular basis , and to instruct the congregation in the basics of Islam . Similar to spiritual leaders , the imam khatib is the one who leads Islamic worship services . More often , the community turns to the mosque imam if they have a religious question . In smaller communities , an imam could also be the community leader . The term is not to be confused with the use of Imams of Shi'a Islam , where it has a meaning more central to belief , referring to main leaders of the Shi'a community . The term imam is also used for a recognized religious scholar or authority in Islam , often for the founding scholars of the four Sunni madhhabs , or schools of jurisprudence ( fiqh ) . It may also refer to the Muslim scholars who created the analytical sciences related to Hadith or it may refer to the heads of the Prophet Muhammad 's family in their generational times . In other words , Imam Ali , referring to Ali ibn Abi Talib , is a phrase commonly used by both Shi'a and Sunni Muslims , though with different connotations . Those who are considered imams in the context of scholarly authority by Sunni Muslims , are listed below : ",

    "text": "A life - size bronze statue of Jan Smuts by the British artist Jacob Epstein stands on the north side of Parliament Square in London , United Kingdom , between a statue of Lord Palmerston and a statue of David Lloyd George . Smuts served as an army general and as a member of the Imperial War Cabinet in the First World War , and then served as Prime Minister of South Africa twice , from 1919 to 1924 and from then 1939 to 1948 . The statue depicts him in his military uniform as a field marshal , leaning forward with his left leg advanced , as if walking forward . The statue stands on a pedestal of granite from South Africa , which bears the inscription . After Winston Churchill won the 1951 UK general election in October 1951 , he proposed erecting a statue in Parliament Square as a memorial to Smuts , who had died in September 1950 . Churchill retired as prime minister in 1955 , and was too ill to perform the unveiling in November 1956 ; it was unveiled instead by the Speaker of the House of Commons , William Morrison . The statue became a Grade II listed building in 1970 . ",

    "text": "The Faliero Coup was a failed 1355 coup designed to overthrow Venice 's established republican government . Strains between the Venetian commoners and the nobility , originally stemming from the catastrophic failure of the nobility in the Battle of Porto - Longo against Venice 's long - time rival , Genoa , are largely considered to be the main cause for the coup . However , traditional stories also point to the marriage of Doge Marino Faliero as a possible cause for the coup . Faliero , an 81 year old man , had recently taken a young bride , who was rumored to be engaged in multiple affairs , including with Michele Steno , a Venetian statesman and future Doge . The consistent rumors and apparent intense arrogance of the established Venetian elite seems to have gotten to Faliero in this explanation for a coup . A more reasonable one , however , is that Faliero wished to transform Venice into a dictatorship , mirroring those of Genoa and other northern Italian city - states . This view is , however , disputed by some historians , who cite Faliero 's apparent regret at his trial , and , his lack of mentioning his belief that a dictatorship would better suit Venice 's interests , a valid argument . These two actions are much more consistent with a man regretting a passionate crime , than one who had executed a calculated plan , some argue . The coup was poorly organized and abortive . Faliero convened with two popular , wealthy , public figures who also had quarlles with the noblility : Bertuccio Isarello and Filippo Calendario . After convincing them of the need for a coup , he laid out his plan : Faliero and Isarello would recruit 20 trusted men who would assist in the overthrow of the government , who would each in turn recruit 40 each . However , due to the incredible variability of any given individuals ' reaction to the plan , rumors of unrest quickly began to spread throughout the city and , the Venetian people , fearing the civil turmoil which was swelling up all around them in northern Italy and Byzantium , reported the rumors to the authorities . One of the most powerful governmental bodies of Republican Venice , the Council of Ten , soon convened to discuss the rumors . They became concerned about the Doge 's role in the plot and , exercising emergency powers , together with the Doge 's councillors , the Signori di Notte , and the six sestieri , ordered the immediate and unquestioned arrest of Calendario and Isarello , who , upon questioning , implicated the Doge . After a series of quick albeit somber trials , the conspirators were imprisoned and executed , including Calendario , Isarello , and Doge Faliero . ",

    "text": "Cornelis or Cornelius Ketel ( 18 March 1548 \u2013 8 August 1616 ) was a Dutch Mannerist painter , active in Elizabethan London from 1573 to 1581 , and in Amsterdam from 1581 to the early 17th century , now known essentially as a portrait - painter , though he was also a poet and orator , and from 1595 began to sculpt as well . According to Ketel 's biography , written by his contemporary Karel van Mander , he seems to have wanted to concentrate on the most prestigious of the hierarchy of genres , history painting , which included mythological subjects , but after he left France he is known almost entirely as a portrait - painter . Neither England nor Holland had much demand for large history paintings during his lifetime , and none of Ketel 's histories or allegorical paintings are known to have survived intact , although drawings and prints survive . He did however significantly influence the development of the largest type of painting commonly produced in the United Provinces at this period , the civic group portrait . ",

    "text": "\" Ne crois pas \" ( , Do n't believe ) is a song that was performed in the Eurovision Song Contest 1956 by French singer Mich\u00e8le Arnaud . It was the first of two Luxembourgish entry in the contest and was performed in French . In contrast to most of the other entries of this Contest , the song is an up - tempo number , with Arnaud telling a friend or lover that the fact that he looks good at the moment is largely meaningless . She tells him that his looks are due to his youth and that , as for the rest of humanity , he will lose his hair , gain weight and possibly lose his teeth as well . Thus , she tells him that he should \" take advantage of it \" , rather than simply enjoying his looks at the time . The song was performed sixth on the night ( following France 's Math\u00e9 Alt\u00e9ry with \" Le temps perdu \" and preceding Italy 's Franca Raimondi with \" Aprite le finestre \" ) . As the scoreboard of this Contest has never been released , definitive statements about scores and positions are impossible to make , however the song did not win . The song was accompanied at the 1956 contest by Arnaud with \" Les amants de minuit \" and was succeeded as Luxembourgish representative at the 1957 contest by Dani\u00e8le Dupr\u00e9 with \" Amours mortes ( tant de peine ) \" .

The project was only active during 1985 and 1986 for just one album , So Red the Rose , which was certified Platinum in the United States and included the singles \" Election Day \" , \" Goodbye Is Forever \" , \" The Flame \" and \" The Promise ( ft . David Gilmour and Sting ) \" . Drummer Roger Taylor appeared in only a few band photographs and in none of the music videos , and stated he was only to be involved in the recording side of the project ( he also had minor involvement in The Power Station , the other Duran Duran splinter group formed by Duran Duran 's Andy and John Taylor alongside Robert Palmer and Tony Thompson of Chic ) . The name of the band was reportedly inspired by the Nicolas Poussin painting Et in Arcadia ego ( also known as \" The Arcadian Shepherds \" ) . ",

    "text": "The Sound Barrier ( known in the United States , as Breaking Through the Sound Barrier and Breaking the Sound Barrier ) is a 1952 British film directed by David Lean . It is a fictional story about attempts by aircraft designers and test pilots to break the sound barrier . It was David Lean 's third and final film with his wife Ann Todd , but it was his first for Alexander Korda 's London Films following the break - up of Cineguild . The Sound Barrier stars Ralph Richardson , Ann Todd , and Nigel Patrick . The Sound Barrier was a box - office success on first release , but it has become one of the least - known of Lean 's films . Following on In Which We Serve ( 1942 ) , the film is another of Lean 's ventures into a genre of filmmaking where impressions of documentary film are created . ",

    "text": "Panlongcheng ( ) or Panlong City is an archaeological site associated with the Erligang culture . The site is located just north of the Yangtze river in Huangpi , Wuhan , Hubei , China . Panlongcheng is the largest excavated Erligang site ( 1 \u00a0 km\u00b2 at its peak ) , showing the southernmost reach of the Erligang culture at its peak . It was discovered in 1954 , and excavated in 1974 and 1976 . The site at Panlongcheng was sparsely inhabited during the Erlitou period , consisting mainly of several small settlements and occupying an area of around 200,000 m\u00b2 . During the early Erligang period , the site suddenly grew rapidly , reaching an area of around with a walled center of 75,000 m\u00b2 . Panlongcheng may have been an Erligang outpost used to control regional resources , such as copper mines . The construction and bronze casting techniques at Panlongcheng are identical with the techniques employed at Erligang and Zhengzhou ; however , the pottery style is different . The style of Erligang elite burials is almost an exact replica of the burials at Zhengzhou ; however , later layers show that the Erligang style disappeared during the later stages of the Erligang culture . The site declined until it was abandoned altogether at the end of the Erligang culture . Panlongcheng 's decline may have been affected in part by the growth of the site at Wucheng . In Hubei Province , other sites such as Jingnansi and Baimiaozhu also feature Erlitou or Late Erlitou \u2013 Early Erligang type of ceramics . ",

During his tenure in the United States House of Representatives , he was included in several lists of Fire - Eaters \u2014 men who adamantly urged the secession of southern states from the United States , and who resisted measures of compromise and reconciliation , leading to the American Civil War . Keitt is notable for being involved in two separate acts of legislative violence in the Congressional chambers . In the first , Keitt assisted Representative Preston Brooks ( D - SC ) in his 1856 attack on Senator Charles Sumner ( R - MA ) in the Senate chamber by brandishing a pistol and cane to prevent other Senators from coming to Sumner 's aid . The second was in 1858 , when he attacked and attempted to choke Representative Galusha Grow ( R - PA ) during an argument on the floor of the U.S. House . When the Civil War began , he served as a deputy of the Provisional Confederate States Congress and later as a colonel in the Confederate States Army , until he was mortally wounded at the Battle of Cold Harbor in June 1864 .

He was of mixed Kurdish - Turkish origin and often identified himself as a \" Kurd of Turkey \" . Many of his albums broke sales records . Kaya , with over 20 albums , is by far one of the most influential and controversial artists of the 20th century in Turkey who was very vocal on social and political issues ; had to flee Turkey for France and died in exile . An elegy \" Ya beni sararsa memleket hasreti / What if I am homesick \" tells the story of his agony , suffering , longing for the people and homeland he was torn away from . Many believe this led to his sudden death at a very young age . Ahmet Kaya paid a huge price announcing his wish \" to sing in the Kurdish language \" when he was invited to stage to receive award at an award ceremony live on TV in 1999 . He was declared a villain by authorities ; targeted with fabricated news as a \" traitor \" by newspapers and TV stations nationwide . Turkish Media portrayed Kaya as \" Part of the Kurdistan Worker 's Party and \" with Abdullah Ocalan \" as a result of his declaration of him being Kurdish . ",

    "text": "The Georgi Dimitrov Mausoleum ( ) was a ceremonial tomb on Prince Alexander of Battenberg Square in Sofia , Bulgaria , from 1949 to 1999 . The white marble mausoleum was built in 1949 to contain the embalmed body of Bulgaria 's first Communist leader , Georgi Dimitrov ( 1882 \u2013 1949 ) , construction beginning immediately after the news of Dimitrov 's death . It was completed in just six days , the time it took Dimitrov 's body to be returned to Sofia from the USSR . Dimitrov 's body remained in the mausoleum until August 1990 , when Dimitrov 's remains were cremated and the ashes buried in the Sofia 's Central Cemetery . The mausoleum itself was destroyed by Prime Minister Ivan Kostov 's UDF government in 1999 after a heated nationwide debate . The prime minister and his party claimed that retaining the mausoleum was inappropriate following the fall of Communism in 1989 because it represented Bulgaria 's repressive past . Even within the government there was opposition to destroying the building , and an opinion poll revealed that two - thirds of the population opposed the demolition . Proposals were made to turn the mausoleum into a museum or art gallery because it contributed to the unique atmosphere of the capital city . In August 1999 , the government made four attempts to demolish the building . The first three failed because they relied on a single powerful explosion . The building did not budge after the first two attempts and tilted only slightly after the third . The fourth ( and successful ) attempt was carried out using a series of consecutive , less powerful explosions . ",

    "text": "TY.O is the third studio album by British record producer and recording artist Taio Cruz . Taking a more electronic music sound than his previous releases , TY.O was released in December 2011 by Universal Island Records but for reasons unknown to Cruz , its British and American release were held off . Instead , a year after its original release , an extended play ( EP ) version of the album titled The Fast Hits was released in the UK on 16 December 2012 . TY.O features a range of top - twenty and top - thirty singles including \" Hangover \" ( featuring Flo Rida ) , \" Troublemaker \" , \" There She Goes \" ( sometimes featuring Pitbull ) , the limited release \" World in Our Hands \" and \" Fast Car \" which features on the Special Edition and Fast Hits versions of the album . The album itself reached top - twenty in Switzerland and top - thirty in Germany , considerably less successful than Cruz 's previous albums . ",

    "text": "Mendenhall Glacier ( also Sitaantaagu ) is a glacier about long located in Mendenhall Valley , about from downtown Juneau in the southeast area of the U.S. state of Alaska . The glacier and surrounding landscape is protected as part of the Mendenhall Glacier Recreation Area , a federally designated unit of the Tongass National Forest . The Juneau Icefield Research Program has monitored the outlet glaciers of the Juneau Icefield since 1942 , including Mendenhall Glacier . The glacier has also retreated since 1929 , when Mendenhall Lake was created , and over since 1500 . The end of the glacier currently has a negative glacier mass balance and will continue to retreat in the foreseeable future . Given that average yearly temperatures are currently increasing , and the outlook is for this trend to continue , it is actually possible that the glacier might experience a period of stabilization or slight advance during its retreating march . This is because increasing amounts of warm , moist air will be carried up to the head of the icefield , where colder ambient temperatures will cause it to precipitate as snow . The increased amount of snow will feed the icefield , possibly enough to offset the continually increasing melting experienced at the glacier 's terminus . However , this interesting phenomenon will fade away if temperatures continue to climb , since the head of the glacier will no longer have cold enough ambient temperatures to cause snow to precipitate .

    "text": "In the New York metropolitan area , the Metropolitan Transportation Authority ( MTA ) runs the New York City Subway , which is mostly manually operated . The subway system currently uses Automatic Block Signaling with fixed wayside signals and automatic train stops . Many portions of the signaling system were installed between the 1930s and 1960s . Because of the age of the subway system , some replacement parts must be custom built for the MTA , as they are otherwise unavailable from signaling suppliers . Additionally , some subway services have reached their train capacity limits and can not operate extra trains with the current system . There are two different schemes of signaling in the system . The most used scheme is found on all of the B Division , which consists of lines originally built to the Brooklyn \u2013 Manhattan Transit Corporation ( BMT ) and Independent Subway System ( IND ) 's wider specifications , as well as on most of the A Division , which consists of lines built to the narrower specifications of the Interborough Rapid Transit Company ( IRT ) . An older system was used on all of the A Division , but with the conversion of the IRT Dyre Avenue Line signals to the B Division scheme , this system is no longer in use . As part of the modernization of the New York City Subway , the MTA has plans to upgrade much of the system with communications - based train control ( CBTC ) technology , which will control the speed and starting and stopping of subway trains . The CBTC system is mostly automated and uses a moving block system \u2013 which reduces headways between trains , increases train frequencies and capacities , and relays the trains ' positions to a control room \u2013 rather than a fixed block system . This will require new rolling stock to be built for the subway system , as only newer trains can use CBTC . ",

    "text": "Guybrush Ulysses Threepwood is the main protagonist of the Monkey Island series of computer adventure games by LucasArts . Guybrush is voiced by actor Dominic Armato in the third , fourth and fifth games , as well as the enhanced remakes of The Secret of Monkey Island and . Though a \" mighty pirate \" by his own account , it is a running joke throughout the games for characters to garble Guybrush Threepwood 's unusual name , either deliberately or accidentally . The origin of the name \" Guybrush \" comes in part from Deluxe Paint , the tool used by the artists to create the character sprite . Since the character had no name at this point , the file was simply called ' Guy ' . When the file was saved , Steve Purcell , the artist responsible for the sprite , added ' brush ' to the filename , indicating that it was the Deluxe Paint \" brush file \" for the \" Guy \" sprite . The file name was then \" guybrush.bbm \" , so the developers eventually just started referring to this unnamed ' Guy ' as \" Guybrush \" . Guybrush 's surname \" Threepwood \" was decided upon in a company contest and is derived from P. G. Wodehouse 's family of characters including Galahad Threepwood and Freddie Threepwood ( with whom he shares similar characteristics ) . \" Threepwood \" is also rumoured to have been the name of Dave Grossman 's RPG character .

    "text": "Piracy on Falcon Lake refers to an increase in crime at the border between the United States and Mexico on Falcon Lake . The lake is a long reservoir of the Rio Grande that was constructed in 1954 and is a known drug smuggling route . A turf war between rival drug cartels for control of the lake began in March 2010 and has led to a series of armed robberies and shooting incidents . All of the attacks were credited to the Los Zetas cartel and occurred primarily on the Mexican side of the reservoir but within sight of the Texas coast . The so - called pirates operate \" fleets \" of small boats designed to seize fisherman and smuggle drugs . While the events have been referred to colloquially as piracy , all the waters of Falcon Lake are considered either US or Mexican territorial waters and therefore are not technically piracy under Article 101 of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea .

It was previously known as the Airport Cricket Ground , before it was taken over by American businessman and cricket enthusiast Allen Stanford , rebuilt in 2004 and named the Stanford Cricket Ground . It was used as one of the many home grounds of the Leeward Islands and also hosted many Twenty20 matches , including both the 2006 & 2008 Stanford 20/20 tournaments and the 2008 Stanford Super Series . Its name was changed to the Coolidge Cricket Ground in 2016 - 17 and it resumed staging cricket matches after an eight - year hiatus . In early 2009 Allen Stanford became the subject of several fraud investigations . On 17 February 2009 he was charged by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) with fraud and multiple violations of U.S. securities laws for alleged \" massive ongoing fraud \" involving $ 7 \u00a0 billion in certificates of deposit . Ten days later the SEC amended its complaint to describe the alleged fraud as a \" massive Ponzi scheme \" . On 6 March 2012 Stanford was convicted on all charges except a single count of wire fraud , and was sentenced to 110 \u00a0 years in prison . The stadium also hosted football matches for Antigua Barracuda FC of USL Pro from 2011 to 2012 . ",

Liang 's father , architect Liang Sicheng , had led attempts to prevent the destruction of the walls surrounding Beijing with the land to be used for the construction of highways . His grandfather Liang Qichao spent 14 years in exile in Japan after he advocated on behalf of turning the Qing Dynasty into a constitutional monarchy . His ancestry came to haunt him during the Maoist Cultural Revolution when he was purged for his being the \" grandson of China 's biggest royalist \" . Liang was ultimately able to attend Peking University . Having learned about the activities of Greenpeace , Liang and three of his colleagues at the Academy for Chinese Culture came to agreement that a corresponding organization was required in China to address growing environmental concerns in that country . The group that they formed , Friends of Nature , eschewed Greenpeace 's more confrontational techniques , choosing to develop grassroots concern about nature through fostering environmental awareness in schools and establishing the nation 's first birdwatching group . The organization worked with the Chinese government to ensure enforcement of existing environmental law , including efforts to protect a Tibetan antelope which were on the path to extinction and videotaping the cutting stands of old - growth forest in Western China that led to a 1999 order by Zhu Rongji prohibiting cutting down such trees . Environmentalist Ma Jun described Liang as having \" incubated the first generation of environmentalists in China \" and described how he worked in conjunction with the government on a \" constructively critical \" basis to build support for protecting the environment . Friends of Nature 's Li Bo credited him with \" promoting ordinary Chinese 's participation in supervising pollution problems and protecting the environment \" . Liang was recognized in 2000 with the Ramon Magsaysay Award , which recognizes Asian contributions to public service , noting that he was able to push environmental issues while having \" avoided the pitfall of alienating government \" . Liang died at the age of 78 on October 28 , 2010 , due to a lung infection while at a hospital in Beijing . He was survived by his wife , a daughter and a son . ",

    "text": "The Time Of The Doves ( also translated as The Pigeon Girl or In Diamond Square ; original Catalan - language : La pla\u00e7a del Diamant , that is Diamond Square ) is a 1962 novel written by exiled Catalan writer Merc\u00e8 Rodoreda . It is notable for its use of stream of consciousness . The book is named after a square in Barcelona 's Gr\u00e0cia district . It is featured in Harold Bloom 's The Western Canon as part of a list of canonical books of the \" Chaotic Age \" . Arguably the author 's most accomplished work , the novel has been translated into more than thirty languages and is regarded as one of the most important pieces of fiction in contemporary Catalan literature . It is also a staple of the curriculum in secondary school programs across Catalonia . Dealing with the Second Spanish Republic and the Spanish Civil War , the novel is set in Barcelona before , during and after the war and pictures a young woman 's struggles in life as well as her conflictive relationships with two men , and her progression from nearly complete submission until she develops a full - fledged outlook in life , personal maturity and independence . It is also a faithful chronicle of life in the city at the time , in a balanced mixture of psychologism and naturalism . ",

    "text": "The perpetual virginity of Mary is a Marian doctrine , taught by the Catholic Church and held by a number of groups in Christianity , which asserts that Mary ( the mother of Jesus ) was \" always a virgin , before , during and after the birth of Jesus Christ . \" This doctrine also proclaims that Mary had no marital relations after Jesus ' birth nor gave birth to any children other than Jesus . While the Bible mentions brothers of Jesus , Catholic , Orthodox , and some traditional Protestant interpretations offer various explanations that align with the doctrine of Mary 's perpetual virginity ; that these siblings were either children of Joseph from a previous marriage , cousins of Jesus , or were closely associated with the Holy Family . By the fourth century , the doctrine was widely supported by the Church Fathers , and by the seventh century it had been affirmed in a number of ecumenical councils . The doctrine is part of the teaching of Catholicism and Anglo - Catholics , as well as Eastern and Oriental Orthodoxy , as expressed in their liturgies , in which they repeatedly refer to Mary as \" ever virgin \" ( ) . The Assyrian Church of the East , which is derived from the Church of the East , also accepts the perpetual virginity of Mary by titling her the \" Ever Virgin \" , after the \" Second Heaven \" . Some early Protestant reformers such as Martin Luther supported the doctrine , and founder figures of Anglicanism such as Hugh Latimer and Thomas Cranmer \" followed the tradition that they had inherited by accepting Mary as ' ever virgin ' \" . Reformed teaching , however , largely abandoned it . The doctrine of perpetual virginity is currently maintained by some Anglican and Lutheran theologians . In addition , John Wesley , the founder of Methodism , affirmed the perpetual virginity of Mary . ",

Its erection began in 1766 after a design by the Brazilian architect and sculptor Ant\u00f4nio Francisco Lisboa , otherwise known as Aleijadinho . Lisboa designed both the structure of the church and the carved decorations on the interior , which were only finished towards the end of the 19th century . The circular bell towers and the oculus closed by a relief were original features in religious architecture of that time in Brazil . The fa\u00e7ade has a single entrance door under a soapstone frontispiece under a relief depicting Saint Francis receiving the stigmata . The interior is richly decorated with golden woodwork , statues and paintings , and the wooden ceiling displays a painting by Manuel da Costa Ata\u00edde . Due to its architecture and historical significance regarding eighteenth century gold mining , this church is classified on the UNESCO World Heritage List . ",

    "text": "The Royal Arsenal , Woolwich carried out armaments manufacture , ammunition proofing , and explosives research for the British armed forces at a site on the south bank of the River Thames in Woolwich in south - east London , England , United Kingdom . It was originally known as the Woolwich Warren , having begun on land previously used as a domestic warren in the grounds of a Tudor house , Tower Place . Much of the initial history of the site is linked with that of the Board of Ordnance , which purchased the Warren in the late 17th century in order to expand an earlier base at Gun Wharf in Woolwich Dockyard . Over the next two centuries , as operations grew and innovations were pursued , the site expanded massively ; at the time of the First World War the Arsenal covered and employed close to 80,000 people . Thereafter its operations were scaled down ; it finally closed as a factory in 1967 and the Ministry of Defence moved out in 1994 . Today the area , so long a secret enclave , is open to the public and is being redeveloped for housing and community use . ",
